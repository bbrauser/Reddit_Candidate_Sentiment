Trump, is now seeking a “very substantial” additional amount in response to his insults on a CNN program just a day after she won her sexual abuse and defamation case.

Ms. Carroll’s filing Monday in Manhattan federal court seeks to intensify the financial pain for Mr. Trump. The jury in her civil case found him liable on May 9 for sexual abuse and defamation. It ordered him to pay Ms. Carroll, a former advice columnist and fixture in Manhattan’s media circles, $2 million for the sexual abuse and $3 million for the defamation.

Monday’s filing came in a separate defamation lawsuit that Ms. Carroll had filed in 2019 against Mr. Trump, 76, which is before the same judge who presided in the civil trial. The older case stemmed from comments Mr. Trump made that year, shortly after she said that he had raped her in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. That lawsuit had been sidetracked by appeals, but is still pending.

In a separate letter to the judge, Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, revealed with little elaboration that Mr. Trump has threatened to file a lawsuit against Ms. Carroll “in retaliation and possibly to seek sanctions.”",47,May 2023,"positive

Joe Biden,democrats,Joe Biden and Steve Ricchetti are master-negotiators and have pulled of the deal of the century,"**In an extremely difficult negotiation situation where republicans were using almost terrorist tactics by holding the economy hostage:**

* Biden got McCarthy to not only agree on a debt ceiling deal this time, but eliminated having to do it again next year. He demanded and got a two year deal

* He not only got McCarthy to agree to raise the debt ceiling, but to eliminate the ceiling altogether for those two years.

* Biden used the debt ceiling negotiations to strike a deal on the annual budget negotiations which would have had to be completed by October 1st. 

* He has basically made three deals in one:

1: ----------This year’s debt ceiling deal

2: ----------This year’s budget negotiation

3: ----------Next year’s debt ceiling deal


* The $80 billion for the IRS which Kevin McCarthy and the GOP demanded be eliminated, was only reduced to $70 billion which is still the largest increase to the agency in history

* Then Biden will take that $10 billion and spread it across areas of so-called spending cuts to neutralize those spending cuts.

* It appears that  Biden has let them cut food stamps but in reality he got more money and more people will be covered

* Republicans had demanded 18% spending cuts across the board in all government programs except the military. They got none of that.

* And though Biden is clearly the winner in this battle, he can not claim victory yet…, (yet being the key word). Otherwise the republicans may change their mind on voting for it. He is clearly letting them think they won. Well at least that they didn’t lose.

* Biden made it appear McCarthy had a victory by “forcing” Biden to negotiate. And got republicans to believe that.  In reality they got nothing. They only achieved the appearance of a win. Biden didn’t care how it made him look. He just gave McCarthy something to claim as a win.

**And just a couple hours ago, the House Rules Committee controlled by republicans voted 7-6 to allow the deal to be voted on tomorrow.**

As a personal guess, I think a secret deal made have been made to have democrats save McCarthy from getting voted out in the battle that will most definitely occur after the deal is passed. I have no evidence to support this. It's just my prediction.

Donald Trump,democrats,Be prepared. The worst may still be yet to come...,"Okay, so what we know is that Donald Trump will be indicted tomorrow for Mishandling classified documents. All charges combine would land him in prison for a maximum of more than 400 years.

In the subpoena it request a document regarding a possible airstrike on Iran with classified details. This document was never recovered by the FBI.

The last weekend of July 2022 Donald Trump hosted the Saudi Open at his Mar-A-Lago golf course. Not to be confused with his golf course at Bedminster New Jersey, where he buried his late first wife Ivana Trump at the first hole, for a tax break on his funeral home/golf course. 

This picture shows where some documents were located on August 8th when the FBI went to seize the classified documents and material. This is believed to be the location of these documents during Saudi Arabia's visit to Mar-A-Lago.

This is just one of the locations, a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago filled with boxes of United States secrets, ranging from nuclear capabilities of the United States and allies, as well as positions of armed forces abroad, ETC. Other locations were a ballroom stage, a storage room and 27 documents in Trump's office. Including one highly classified document in his desk drawer.

""Among the items seized, according to the list, were 18 documents marked as top secret, 54 marked as secret, 31 marked as confidential and 11,179 government documents or photographs without classification markings. Forty-eight empty folders marked as having contained classified information were also taken, though the list did not specify whether that information was recovered"" NY Times. So why is Trump only being charged with just 31 counts of retaining government documents?

In order to have a trial to convict Trump, the department of Justice has to show some form of these classified documents to a jury to prove their case. These will probably be heavily redacted or files that are no longer endangering any lives by disclosing what is in them. But there are some files that are so top secret the department of Justice is not even going to bring charges because they would then have to show a jury the substance of these files.

Some believe these are initial charges and there are more charges to come. In my opinion this man will prove to be a traitor to the highest degree and I am extremely interested in seeing what more we learn after the official arrest tomorrow morning. But just a forewarning, don't be surprised if we find out there is so much more to his retention of government document",1018,Jun 2023,"positive

Donald Trump,Liberal,The US is following the trajectory of the Roman Republic before the rise of the imperial dictatorship,"
The level of income inequality and xenophobia go hand and in hand.  This is why we need to understand that Donald Trump and his movement is the natural progression of a society that is utterly corrupt and broken and undemocratic.  The Democrats distract with the social issues and the Republicans are piggybacking off of them to the same effect.   

This has led to the rise of a fascist movement in the U.S.  What will the liberals and leftists do when a real fascist comes to power in the US with the military and police under that movement’s control?  Do you think hashtag activism is going to work against such a group?  

There is a phenomenon on Reddit which is related to this inability to understand any viewpoint other than your own of banning people you don’t agree with or you can’t out argue with your talking points.   The liberals and leftists are going to face a massive backlash from moderates and right wingers and fascists in which they are going to be forced back into the wilderness.   

This is why I have been banned on several subreddits for simple benign statements.  I have been downvoted dozens of times for basic comments which shouldn’t be considered controversial but because it offends someone.  I wonder what these people will do when Trump comes back to power or DeSantis comes to power and he places his anti LGBT book ban in schools across the nation?  

This is why a society like the US is destined to follow Romes path and it will happen sooner rather than later.  Empires fall faster than in the past.  We won’t linger over centuries like Rome.

Donald Trump,democrats,BREAKING: Indicted 2024 Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump throws his son Eric Trump under the bus while testifying under oath in New York Attorney General Letitia James’ case against Trump and the Trump Organization.,"In his shocking testimony, Trump betrayed Eric when he was asked if he is the one with the “ultimate decision-making authority” at the Trump Organization, and he responded, “No. My son Eric is much more involved with it than I am. I’ve been doing other things.”

This immediately caught the eye of New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman, who responded by telling CNN that it’s “notable” that Trump threw his own son Eric to the wolves by “making Eric the front person in the context of this lawsuit” and fingering his son as the “responsible party” in the Trump Organization’s fraud.  

So there you have it, folks. Trump has finally reached the point where he is throwing his own children — who have been his most loyal supporters — to the wolves in order to save his own skin. 

What a fitting and pathetic ending to Trump’s criminal family enterprise.

Donald Trump,Conservative,Judge outlines next steps for dissolving Trump's companies," As the questioning of witnesses continues, Judge Engoron has issued an order outlining the next steps to dissolve Trump's companies in New York.

Engoron [last week](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-submitted-fraudulent-valuations-assets-secure-loans/story?id=103508205) found that Trump and his adult sons used fraudulent documents to conduct business, and ordered the cancellation of his business certificates in the state. Trump appealed that ruling yesterday.

In today's order, Engoron asks the defendants to provide a list of ""entities controlled or beneficially owned by Donald J. Trump"" -- and the other co-defendants -- to the Hon. Barbara S. Jones, the independent monitor overseeing Trump's business activities.

Trump is also required to notify Jones of any new business applications or changes to preexisting entities.

The order also gives the parties 30 days to recommend a receiver to oversee the dissolution of Trump's corporate assets. However both parties previously suggested that they plan to recommend Jones for that position.

Joe Biden,Libertarian,I Have Been a Party Affiliated Libertarian Since 2002...,"Throughout my active participation in campaigning and supporting the party for two decades I have noticed a shift in what we are able to focus on verses what the country is focusing on.

When war and the economy are the focus, we tend to follow suit in that discussion and focus our energy there. While I'm a Buddhist and a Libertarian and completely non-confrontational... Even I can admit the war lords are better at fighting war lords than me. The libertarian argument against the right-winged war machine is pretty pointless so long as they are winning the blood bath du-jour. 'Merica!

When civil liberties and domestic policy are able to take a precedent to global catastrophy for a few years it seems the focus of the party returns to personal liberty and constitutional rights for all Americans. And the party seems to do better during those times. I think it's because we have a strong argument for domestic policy.

As a non-interventionist party, shouldn't we always focus our energy on domestic policy and fixing what we can do here first? I think there is a market for that, maybe not on the Presidential stage but certainly at the state and local levels. I think debating foreign policy in main stream politics should be secondary to fixing our issues at home. Gary Johnson got railed on his lack of 24/7 foreign policy coverage. It didn't really bother me... Good grief what I'd give to be sending him over Grandpa Joe to Israel right now!! Even still...that's not why I wanted him there. He'd have people for that.

Joe Biden,Conservative,The Case Against Trump being the GOP Nominee,"Essay I found that covers a whole host of issues with Trump from those who are backing DeSantis. I know most people aren't going to want to read this. But it gives the complete break down of problems with a Trump candidate and just Trump in general. And before you go ""TDS, derp a derp"". I voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Nostalgia and martyrdom shouldn't be clouding your judgment. If anything bullet number 2 should make you question your support given what will happen. Yes, I also believe the the prosecutions are politically motivated. That will not change the outcome of what we all know is going to happen.

Anyways, hopefully people take the time to digest this. Though most likely it will be buried into oblivion never to be seen by the average subreddit user while I will get ""TDS"" spammed in the response. This is about the good of our country, which Democrats are determined to bring to ruin.

----

Here are the Top 25 reasons (version 3.1) most DeSantis supporters are done with Trump, even though nearly all of us voted for him twice:

1 - **He didn't deliver on his frequent campaign refrains**: ""drain the swamp"" or ""build the wall and make Mexico pay for it"" or ""lock her up."" 

The swamp got worse during his Presidency because he added to it. He made no effort to ""drain"" any of it. 
Remnants of the wall lay rusting along the border or have been sold off. Recently, Trump confessed there was no actual mechanism to get Mexico to pay for the wall. 
He let Hillary off the hook two weeks after taking office, saying the idea of it sold well before the election. As if that broken promise wasn't enough, a few weeks later, Trump invited the Clintons to his inaugural luncheon, pointed to them, thanked them for coming, said he was honored they attended, led a standing ovation for them, and then proclaimed, ""I have a lot of respect for those two people.""

Other Promises unkept: Trump DID NOT—Repeal the alternative minimum tax, Cut the number of tax brackets, End birthright citizenship, Enact 5-year ban on White House and congressional officials from lobbying, Impose death penalty for cop killers, Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Impose a hiring freeze on federal employees, Eliminate wasteful spending in every department, Place lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for foreign government, Bring back manufacturing, Grow the economy by 4 percent a year, Add additional federal investment of $20 billion toward School Choice, Adopt the penny plan, Cancel all funding of sanctuary cities, Dramatically scale back the U.S. Education Department, Expand national right to carry to all 50 states (in fact, Trump went after the 2nd Amendment), Remove all undocumented immigrants, Eliminate gun-free zones at schools and military bases, Eliminate Common Core, Triple ICE enforcement, Get Congress to allow health insurance across state lines, Renegotiate the Iran deal, or Repeal and replace Obamacare, AND many other promises.

2 - **He will be embroiled in legal troubles throughout the general campaign**, will likely lose independents and the election, and I shudder to think what that does down ballot. He WILL be convicted in one or more of these cases. Getting a fair trial in a DC court if you are a republican or conservative is a unicorn. Trump is facing 4 criminal cases with 3 leftist jury pools in NY, DC, and Fulton County, GA. The idea he won’t be convicted is unbelievably naïve. Federal indictments have a 91+% success rate and Trump is facing two federal cases with multiple indictments. The first case in GA is a RICO prosecution that three of Trump's lawyers have already plead guilty to lesser charges and will be testifying. It is conceivable that Trump is convicted in GA by JAN/FEB 2024, perhaps before the Iowa Caucuses.
MAGA says they are all bogus and he will win on appeal. Again, this is incredibly naïve. The appeals process can take years and Trump would have to thread the needle on ALL of them to avoid prison time or house arrest.
But what does even one conviction mean to the GOP’s chances of winning the election? MAGA believes in “polls” now, so let’s go there. **A Reuters poll in August suggests that Trump could lose up to 50% or more of Republican voters if Trump is convicted**. That’s right, Republican voters. Even if this poll is half accurate, Trump's lose would be the largest landslide in history. This idea that everyone outside of MAGA (other Republicans, Moderates, Independents) would interpret a conviction like MAGA does, as ""political persecution,"" and vote Trump into office so that he could pardon himself, is ludicrous.

MAGA points to the current polls showing him in a virtual tie or leading Biden. Sure. These “polls” are 13 months from a general election. That's before the incessant drum beat for a whole year during the general, when ad after ad and the media attack Trump over these court cases and everything else. 40+% of voters are indifferent, superficial, impressionable, or are currently not paying attention. Do you think it was an accident that the DC trial date is the day before Super Tuesday? These people know Trump’s empathy appeal spikes his polls and they’re counting on you to feel bad for him and make him the nominee. If a convicted Trump is our nominee, we lose everything. It's a trap. Don't fall for it.

3 - **Even if he miraculously wins, he loses**. He might pardon himself for the federal charges, but what about the state charges? How will that self-pardon play? “The first President to ever pardon himself.” Good luck in 2026 and 2028 with that narrative noose around our GOP necks. If Dems win the House, they will impeach him again for one or more of these convictions. And what if he is actually guilty for even one of these charges? I hope not, but what if he did even one of the things he’s indicted for? How does that sit with you? Either way, innocent or not, it won’t be resolved for years, and it won’t change the effect. Even if he’s cleared of all charges, he won't be able to govern because no agency will work with him knowing they can just wait him out. Congress won't either. Why would they work with a damaged President to fix anything? Good luck cleaning house when no one will work with you. Who is going to serve in a second Trump admin? His chief of staff was indicted in GA. What quality people are going to sign up to serve if Trump is going to engage in even one questionable act that may drag them down with him?  Are we winning one or both houses? Good luck passing legislation without both Houses. Ruling by Executive Orders like he did the first time will be a nice temporary relief, but you better stock up for the next Democrat in office. Trump will be a lame duck the moment he takes the oath.

4 - **He's almost 80, and he looks all of it and unwell**. He’s almost 80 and running for the most demanding job in the world. Don't complain about Biden's age and then elect Trump. Americans have been retired for nearly a decade at this point in their lives. Old people don’t decline at a steady rate. They decline rapidly. Instead of MAGA telling him, ""Thank you. Well done. You exposed them. We got this. Retire and help us win,"" they're trying to martyr him and blow up the GOP in the process. Well, that isn't very bright. Unless you want to form your own viable party or tolerate the alternative, a leftist hellscape that used to be America, blowing up the GOP is not an option. The GOP isn't perfect, but it isn't homogenous, and it never will be. You must tolerate mushy moderates because 50+% of the country are NEVER going to be MAGA purists. I don’t want another octogenarian as President. Reagan had Alzheimer’s during his second term, Biden is a walking corpse. Not doing that again.

5 – **Trump is not a good judge of character** and frequently lets foxes in the henhouse if they stroke his ego.

6 – A very large number of people who worked with him and for him are not supporting him in 2024. In fact, **40 out of 44 cabinet members he hired are not supporting his 2024 bid**. MAGA will say they are all losers or RINOs he exposed. To that, I say, it's unlikely that they are all bad people. But if they are, please see #5.

7 - **Trump wasn't prepared when he took office and left hundreds of Obama holdovers in power**. These same people undermined him and his administration. MAGA always points to the unprecedented level of attacks, internal “deep state” pushback, allegations, and unnamed sources within the government undermining him. They fail to realize, acknowledge, or accept that Trump allowed most of this to happen because he was incompetent and unprepared to handle the duties of President. If you leave leftists in power, they will torch you the first chance they get. He didn’t admit to these mistakes and change direction. Trump left leftists and swamp creatures in power even as they undermined him.

8 – No matter how he frames it and revises history, after Covid happened, **he did everything Fauci and company wanted and signed whatever legislation Nancy Pelosi put in front of him**, including the Cares Act, which turned out to be the biggest tool of the 2020 vote steal. Certainly, no one knew the severity of the virus or the science of Covid that early on, and he couldn’t have known how he was being lied to at the time, but he refused to remove Fauci from the task force, gave Fauci an award on the way out the door, and basically ceded the management of the country over to the medical swamp for most of the final year of his term. To this day, he refuses to acknowledge his mistakes, defends the vax, falsely claims his vax has saved 100 million lives, falsely claims he couldn’t have removed Fauci, and claims he did everything right.

9 – **Trump spent us into oblivion during his first term**. Sure, Covid happened, but he was running trillion dollar plus deficits every year before Covid. There wasn’t a single spending bill Trump didn’t sign. He ran up almost 8 trillion dollars of debt (62% of which came BEFORE Covid), and failed again to live up to his campaign and administration promises. You can't print/spend/borrow 7.8 trillion above incoming tax revenue and NOT also expect eventual inflation, higher interest rates, and a devalued dollar. Look at your gas prices and grocery bill. Obama, Biden, AND Trump DID THAT.

10 – **Trump had the WH, House, and Senate his first two years and squandered his Congressional majorities**. He failed to replace Obamacare. He failed to permanently secure the border, because Executive Orders don’t last and the wall, finished or not, clearly doesn’t work on its own. He failed to address term limits in Congress. He failed to drain the swamp even one millimeter, which is probably the biggest, most impactful failure of all. He ruled by Executive Orders his whole Presidency, which Biden trash canned his first day in office. The ONLY policies/deeds of significance that remain from Trump's Presidency are his court appointments that he picked from a list that was handed to him and unpaid for tax cuts that are about to expire.

11 - **His obsession with loyalty always seems to be a one-way street**, especially if it means that his money is involved (i.e., J6ers, Rudy G, K. Mac, those indicted with him, etc.). These people “bled” for him and he trashes them or refuses to help them. He could have helped pay for non-violent J6er’s defense, he could have at least visited them in prison, he could have used his contacts to possibly make a difference in their treatment, or perhaps he could have even showed some meaningful public support for them. He did NOTHING. To this day, he’s DONE NOTHING. What he DID DO on January 6th: Trump held the rally in DC. He worked up his supporters into a frenzy with the belief that their election had been stolen. He said J6ers should march to the capital. Then, he then went out the next day and publicly called them criminals. He ultimately raised 250 million off the “Stop the Steal” campaign after the election and spent ZERO dollars to help pay for the legal expenses J6ers faced.

12 - **His ""airing of grievances,"" court cases, and whole focus is on the past**. I'm not interested in the past. Was it stolen? Even if you discount the suitcases under benches and trucks rolling in at 3 AM, state secretaries changed the rules without their legislatures and the media/gov/social media suppressed the HB laptop story, so YES, it was stolen. But, Trump lost, even enabling the instruments of that loss (Cares Act), he didn't protect the elections, and whether it was stolen or not, crooked Joe Biden is in the WH. Trump was in charge and he let it happen.

13 - **Trump DOES NOT have the ability to engage in meaningful exchanges where he explains and sells his choices, policies, comments, and governing philosophy**. He doesn't fight the narratives festering around him. Calling it ""fake news,"" while true, is not an adequate defense to keep the proposed narrative from defining you. You must attack the narrative and the premises under it with logic, reason, and voracity. If you dismantle the narrative or the argument or the loaded reporter question, you stop the media and democrats from selling their crap to the public. Trump is either unwilling or incapable of doing this, and doing this is extremely integral to getting legislation passed and winning elections.

14 - **He regularly punches down at people and engages in petty battles that mean nothing**. The list of people and organizations Trump has needlessly attacked over some perceived slight or his ego, using the public platform of his Presidency and 2024 candidacy, is too long to catalogue here.

15 - **He doesn't deserve the nomination if he's unwilling to earn it**. He is not owed anything. There is no such thing as ""his turn."" This isn’t a monarchy. Candidates who throw their hat into the ring are NOT “disloyal.” Skipping debates because of 'polling numbers' is entitled and indicative of someone who is afraid to defend his record or defend his reasons for seeking a second term. He is not even campaigning more than a few times a month. He spends his days golfing and rage truthing and making dozens of ludicrous video mini-speeches, as if he’s still President.

16 - He's a clever politician, entertainer, marketer, and businessman, but **his positions and principles are often for sale if the deal is right**.

17 - **Trump is woefully arrogant, a malignant narcissist**, and makes every single thing about himself. He rarely says ""we,"" refers to himself constantly in the 3rd person, and that says a lot.

18 - Trump's campaign is tangentially about the future, but that's not the main thrust of it. **His campaign is mostly about revenge and his ego**, not the good of the country. If he was thinking solely about the country, he would drop out, handle his legal woes, and help us do what he was unable to do.

19 - **Ultra MAGA, his cult following, not the persuadable, is nothing more than an identity group engaging in identity politics**. They are an identity group, just like BLM, feminists, LGBTQ, etc. They held up Trump as their champion because they felt disenfranchised, marginalized, and oppressed, and Trump was the force they put forward to tear it all down. At first, like many identity groups, there was validity to many of their grievances. The working class had been forgotten, the system was and is not working on their behalf. But unlike most identity groups, they wanted the existing system to begin working for them. They wanted a course correction. However, like ALL identity groups, their impetus changed and devolved into something darker and delusional. Ultra MAGA wants to tear it all down. They want a system that is right in their own eyes. They want to abandon the rule of law and exact ""justice"" on their own terms. Where their interests and the Constitution align, they embrace it. Where it doesn't, they ignore it. Ultra MAGA embraces and employs the tactics of leftists now. They are now what these other identity groups always were, militant grievance hustlers who ignore truth and morality and reality to serve their own ends. Trump is their vehicle, their champion, because he is the embodiment of their moral evolution. He was in 2016 what they've become in 2023.
If this battle is not about realistic policy goals and re-constitutionalizing our government, and it's about name-calling, tearing down proven conservatives and good people, and constantly lobbing hate and false accusations, we deserve to lose. We are no better than the leftists who do it.

20 - While the ""listless vessel"" comment hurt Trump’s cult of personality voters, DeSantis wasn't wrong, and it needed to be said. This isn’t name calling. It’s just the objective truth. **Some of these Trump supporters act like he’s second only to Christ himself and no matter what he says or does, they defend it**. They “feel” Trump. Trump is their persecuted, post-modern Jesus, a relativistic elixir salesman promising miracles, so they’ll find any excuse to validate their support and vote for him, even if he’s not worthy of it. I’m not sure where this comes from. Perhaps these devotees relate to his defiant demeanor, his grievance politics, because they too feel like victims of this economy and society and life in general, and they live vicariously through his full-throated “screw you” to the world. But it’s a cloud, some fog they all live in. Trump is not coming on a white horse to vanquish all their real and perceived enemies. He’s not going to deal some great vengeance on the deep state or lock all these bad actors up, for all the reasons I have already mentioned. Re-capturing our freedoms and our country can't be about one man.

21 – **Where is Melania? Where is his wife?** Between the court cases and his family, Trump has more pressing matters to attend to. His ego needs to take a back seat and he needs to step down for the good of the country and himself.

22 - **Trump thinks evangelicals are idiots, chumps** who can be manipulated because we are, in his mind, hyper-emotional followers of some sky wizard he knows nothing about. It was his recent speech in DC that confirmed this.
First, he bumbled through the issue of abortion for 3-4 minutes, repeating himself and talking about ""making deals"" on the issue. He's not seriously pro-life. He is not principled on any issue. His principles are for sale if the deal is right. In the recent interview with Meet the Press, he talked in a way that suggests he wants to apply the Art of the Deal to the arbitration of human life, and it was SICK. Making a deal with Democrats on abortion means ""Trump will sell the Pro-Life Movement out."" He didn't even push back on the lies of the interviewer who falsely asserted over and over that ""no Democrat"" wants late term abortion access.
Second, Trump told the audience that Melania was watching from home and that she called him about the persecution he is going through, but he has yet to explain why she is never with him anymore. He wanted evangelicals, who he believes are ""suckers"" for the concept of healthy marriages, to believe there is nothing wrong in his marriage when it is clear there is something wrong.
Third, Trump's team badly timed some hollywood-esque dramatic background music at the end of his speech and he faked a tragic hero act to swoon us, because he thinks we're all stupid saps who cry at Lifetime and Hallmark movies. Except, the timing of the music was off because he goes off script so much that the content he read had zero emotional value. He wasn't at the big closing, so the music and persecuted Trump act came off as awkward and manipulative. So, tell me evangelicals, are you as stupid as Trump believes you are?

23 – **Trump is NOT the fantastic leader people make him out to be**. Outside of a combative demeanor, maybe some courage and a ham-fisted level of delegation, he's mostly a barking entertainer. To this day, he NEVER admits his failures, he belittles people for any perceived slight or valid criticism, he lies about what he has said and his record, he praises and relates to despicable people, and he completely lacks the following leadership qualities: Communication, Empathy, Humility, Integrity, Emotional Intelligence, Creativity, Accountability, Learning agility, Self-awareness, Active Listening, Empowerment, Positivity, Honesty, Focus, Strategy, and the Courage to do what is right despite the political consequences.

24 – **Trump has always been an unwise, gaffe-prone, ego-feeding, insult machine**, and though it can be entertaining when he angers all the right people, it can be deflating and even harmful when he makes everything about himself and criticizes the people who support him and the allies who America needs to support. Recent example - While it is true that Israel and Bibi failed to secure their borders and protect their citizens, Trump did NOT need to harp on this obvious failure 4 days after Israel’s 9/11 scale terrorist attack. He publicly criticized Bibi, the IDF Defense minister, and then showed respect to the enemy of Israel, Hezbollah, as “very smart.” The bodies of our 25 countrymen and 1400 allies were not even cold. American hostages remain un-rescued. Trump lacks wisdom. He lacks timing. He lacks leadership. Right after the slaughter of innocents, Trump chose to highlight his personal issues with Netanyahu, and that is disgusting.

25 - **Trump 2023 is NOT Trump 2016, and it isn't even close**. Some of it is clearly his age. Trump spends his days golfing, rage-truthing, and delivering Trump PSAs to his iPhone in front of his Mar-A-Lago fireplace. In many ways, Trump is like my rapidly aging Great Uncle, who slurs his words, can't hear very well, screams at the television, and tells stories about the ""good ole' days"" where he is always the central heroic figure. My Great Uncle is entertaining, but I'd be nuts to take a single thing he says as fact or take one piece of advice he gives outside of how to make his eggs for breakfast. This is Trump in front of waning crowds in 2023—a disillusioned and delusional entertainer who tells every story with himself at the center, who rails at unseen enemies, and who hasn't yet realized that his time to leave the stage has long since passed.

**Conclusion** – Trump’s failures as President, his challenges in getting elected and governing effectively, and his deep and pervasive personal flaws leads to ONLY ONE conclusion - **Trump is NOT qualified to be our choice for President in 2024**. Choosing a path for our country that includes Trump in any role of leadership will lead to the ruination of the GOP and to a trifecta of Democrat power and every leftist law imaginable.

The Only Choice — DeSantis has all the leadership traits in spades. He is a much, MUCH better option moving forward. He's not an entertainer. But he is an honest, competent, highly intelligent, effective, and principled leader. He can also serve 2 terms.
RD isn’t “bought” a “RINO” or a “globalist."" Those people who try to use “guilt by association” ignore Trump’s associations with these same people WHILE he was in office and afterward (Ryan, Rove, Bush, etc.). Trump endorsed and is endorsed by numerous ""RINOs.""

DeSantis, however, came from a middle-class family. He's a veteran, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in Congress who sold all his stock to avoid even the hint of impropriety. He rejected his Congressional pension because he believes government should be about selfless-service. He left Congress after three terms because he believes in term limits. He then became the best governor Florida has ever seen, delivering on every single promise. DeSantis is a family man and a fighter against false narratives. He’s also a 5-time winner who has done ALL he said he would do. He’s a relentless, shrewd administrator and leader who gives us the best chance to win and make a significant dent in the government bureaucracy.

The Presidency should not be a sepulchre for the aging politicians, family dynasties, statesmen, or even heroes of our time. 
The Presidency should not house the idols of our sports teams, films, or TV programs. 
The Presidency should not raise any man to the office  who might be esteemed to be more than he is, just a man. 
The Presidency should be attained by a man who is willing to put country before self, who has the energy to work 80–90-hour weeks, who does what is objectively and morally right, no matter the cost. 
The Presidency should be given to a man who has proven his honesty, who has delivered on his promises, who has fought his enemies and won time and again, and who has led with competence, integrity, humility, empathy, and effectiveness through challenging times and crises. 
Ron DeSantis should be chosen as our next President. There has never been a clearer choice. It’s simply time to turn the page on Trump. We have a MUCH better option.",38,Oct 2023,"positive
opinion","The Case Against Trump being the GOP Nominee Essay I found that covers a whole host of issues with Trump from those who are backing DeSantis. I know most people aren't going to want to read this. But it gives the complete break down of problems with a Trump candidate and just Trump in general. And before you go ""TDS, derp a derp"". I voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Nostalgia and martyrdom shouldn't be clouding your judgment. If anything bullet number 2 should make you question your support given what will happen. Yes, I also believe the the prosecutions are politically motivated. That will not change the outcome of what we all know is going to happen.

Anyways, hopefully people take the time to digest this. Though most likely it will be buried into oblivion never to be seen by the average subreddit user while I will get ""TDS"" spammed in the response. This is about the good of our country, which Democrats are determined to bring to ruin.

----

Here are the Top 25 reasons (version 3.1) most DeSantis supporters are done with Trump, even though nearly all of us voted for him twice:

1 - **He didn't deliver on his frequent campaign refrains**: ""drain the swamp"" or ""build the wall and make Mexico pay for it"" or ""lock her up."" 

The swamp got worse during his Presidency because he added to it. He made no effort to ""drain"" any of it. 
Remnants of the wall lay rusting along the border or have been sold off. Recently, Trump confessed there was no actual mechanism to get Mexico to pay for the wall. 
He let Hillary off the hook two weeks after taking office, saying the idea of it sold well before the election. As if that broken promise wasn't enough, a few weeks later, Trump invited the Clintons to his inaugural luncheon, pointed to them, thanked them for coming, said he was honored they attended, led a standing ovation for them, and then proclaimed, ""I have a lot of respect for those two people.""

Other Promises unkept: Trump DID NOT—Repeal the alternative minimum tax, Cut the number of tax brackets, End birthright citizenship, Enact 5-year ban on White House and congressional officials from lobbying, Impose death penalty for cop killers, Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Impose a hiring freeze on federal employees, Eliminate wasteful spending in every department, Place lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for foreign government, Bring back manufacturing, Grow the economy by 4 percent a year, Add additional federal investment of $20 billion toward School Choice, Adopt the penny plan, Cancel all funding of sanctuary cities, Dramatically scale back the U.S. Education Department, Expand national right to carry to all 50 states (in fact, Trump went after the 2nd Amendment), Remove all undocumented immigrants, Eliminate gun-free zones at schools and military bases, Eliminate Common Core, Triple ICE enforcement, Get Congress to allow health insurance across state lines, Renegotiate the Iran deal, or Repeal and replace Obamacare, AND many other promises.

2 - **He will be embroiled in legal troubles throughout the general campaign**, will likely lose independents and the election, and I shudder to think what that does down ballot. He WILL be convicted in one or more of these cases. Getting a fair trial in a DC court if you are a republican or conservative is a unicorn. Trump is facing 4 criminal cases with 3 leftist jury pools in NY, DC, and Fulton County, GA. The idea he won’t be convicted is unbelievably naïve. Federal indictments have a 91+% success rate and Trump is facing two federal cases with multiple indictments. The first case in GA is a RICO prosecution that three of Trump's lawyers have already plead guilty to lesser charges and will be testifying. It is conceivable that Trump is convicted in GA by JAN/FEB 2024, perhaps before the Iowa Caucuses.
MAGA says they are all bogus and he will win on appeal. Again, this is incredibly naïve. The appeals process can take years and Trump would have to thread the needle on ALL of them to avoid prison time or house arrest.
But what does even one conviction mean to the GOP’s chances of winning the election? MAGA believes in “polls” now, so let’s go there. **A Reuters poll in August suggests that Trump could lose up to 50% or more of Republican voters if Trump is convicted**. That’s right, Republican voters. Even if this poll is half accurate, Trump's lose would be the largest landslide in history. This idea that everyone outside of MAGA (other Republicans, Moderates, Independents) would interpret a conviction like MAGA does, as ""political persecution,"" and vote Trump into office so that he could pardon himself, is ludicrous.

MAGA points to the current polls showing him in a virtual tie or leading Biden. Sure. These “polls” are 13 months from a general election. That's before the incessant drum beat for a whole year during the general, when ad after ad and the media attack Trump over these court cases and everything else. 40+% of voters are indifferent, superficial, impressionable, or are currently not paying attention. Do you think it was an accident that the DC trial date is the day before Super Tuesday? These people know Trump’s empathy appeal spikes his polls and they’re counting on you to feel bad for him and make him the nominee. If a convicted Trump is our nominee, we lose everything. It's a trap. Don't fall for it.

3 - **Even if he miraculously wins, he loses**. He might pardon himself for the federal charges, but what about the state charges? How will that self-pardon play? “The first President to ever pardon himself.” Good luck in 2026 and 2028 with that narrative noose around our GOP necks. If Dems win the House, they will impeach him again for one or more of these convictions. And what if he is actually guilty for even one of these charges? I hope not, but what if he did even one of the things he’s indicted for? How does that sit with you? Either way, innocent or not, it won’t be resolved for years, and it won’t change the effect. Even if he’s cleared of all charges, he won't be able to govern because no agency will work with him knowing they can just wait him out. Congress won't either. Why would they work with a damaged President to fix anything? Good luck cleaning house when no one will work with you. Who is going to serve in a second Trump admin? His chief of staff was indicted in GA. What quality people are going to sign up to serve if Trump is going to engage in even one questionable act that may drag them down with him?  Are we winning one or both houses? Good luck passing legislation without both Houses. Ruling by Executive Orders like he did the first time will be a nice temporary relief, but you better stock up for the next Democrat in office. Trump will be a lame duck the moment he takes the oath.

4 - **He's almost 80, and he looks all of it and unwell**. He’s almost 80 and running for the most demanding job in the world. Don't complain about Biden's age and then elect Trump. Americans have been retired for nearly a decade at this point in their lives. Old people don’t decline at a steady rate. They decline rapidly. Instead of MAGA telling him, ""Thank you. Well done. You exposed them. We got this. Retire and help us win,"" they're trying to martyr him and blow up the GOP in the process. Well, that isn't very bright. Unless you want to form your own viable party or tolerate the alternative, a leftist hellscape that used to be America, blowing up the GOP is not an option. The GOP isn't perfect, but it isn't homogenous, and it never will be. You must tolerate mushy moderates because 50+% of the country are NEVER going to be MAGA purists. I don’t want another octogenarian as President. Reagan had Alzheimer’s during his second term, Biden is a walking corpse. Not doing that again.

5 – **Trump is not a good judge of character** and frequently lets foxes in the henhouse if they stroke his ego.

6 – A very large number of people who worked with him and for him are not supporting him in 2024. In fact, **40 out of 44 cabinet members he hired are not supporting his 2024 bid**. MAGA will say they are all losers or RINOs he exposed. To that, I say, it's unlikely that they are all bad people. But if they are, please see #5.

7 - **Trump wasn't prepared when he took office and left hundreds of Obama holdovers in power**. These same people undermined him and his administration. MAGA always points to the unprecedented level of attacks, internal “deep state” pushback, allegations, and unnamed sources within the government undermining him. They fail to realize, acknowledge, or accept that Trump allowed most of this to happen because he was incompetent and unprepared to handle the duties of President. If you leave leftists in power, they will torch you the first chance they get. He didn’t admit to these mistakes and change direction. Trump left leftists and swamp creatures in power even as they undermined him.

8 – No matter how he frames it and revises history, after Covid happened, **he did everything Fauci and company wanted and signed whatever legislation Nancy Pelosi put in front of him**, including the Cares Act, which turned out to be the biggest tool of the 2020 vote steal. Certainly, no one knew the severity of the virus or the science of Covid that early on, and he couldn’t have known how he was being lied to at the time, but he refused to remove Fauci from the task force, gave Fauci an award on the way out the door, and basically ceded the management of the country over to the medical swamp for most of the final year of his term. To this day, he refuses to acknowledge his mistakes, defends the vax, falsely claims his vax has saved 100 million lives, falsely claims he couldn’t have removed Fauci, and claims he did everything right.

9 – **Trump spent us into oblivion during his first term**. Sure, Covid happened, but he was running trillion dollar plus deficits every year before Covid. There wasn’t a single spending bill Trump didn’t sign. He ran up almost 8 trillion dollars of debt (62% of which came BEFORE Covid), and failed again to live up to his campaign and administration promises. You can't print/spend/borrow 7.8 trillion above incoming tax revenue and NOT also expect eventual inflation, higher interest rates, and a devalued dollar. Look at your gas prices and grocery bill. Obama, Biden, AND Trump DID THAT.

10 – **Trump had the WH, House, and Senate his first two years and squandered his Congressional majorities**. He failed to replace Obamacare. He failed to permanently secure the border, because Executive Orders don’t last and the wall, finished or not, clearly doesn’t work on its own. He failed to address term limits in Congress. He failed to drain the swamp even one millimeter, which is probably the biggest, most impactful failure of all. He ruled by Executive Orders his whole Presidency, which Biden trash canned his first day in office. The ONLY policies/deeds of significance that remain from Trump's Presidency are his court appointments that he picked from a list that was handed to him and unpaid for tax cuts that are about to expire.

11 - **His obsession with loyalty always seems to be a one-way street**, especially if it means that his money is involved (i.e., J6ers, Rudy G, K. Mac, those indicted with him, etc.). These people “bled” for him and he trashes them or refuses to help them. He could have helped pay for non-violent J6er’s defense, he could have at least visited them in prison, he could have used his contacts to possibly make a difference in their treatment, or perhaps he could have even showed some meaningful public support for them.

He worked up his supporters into a frenzy with the belief that their election had been stolen. He said J6ers should march to the capital. Then, he then went out the next day and publicly called them criminals. He ultimately raised 250 million off the “Stop the Steal” campaign after the election and spent ZERO dollars to help pay for the legal expenses J6ers faced.

12 - **His ""airing of grievances,"" court cases, and whole focus is on the past**. I'm not interested in the past. Was it stolen? Even if you discount the suitcases under benches and trucks rolling in at 3 AM, state secretaries changed the rules without their legislatures and the media/gov/social media suppressed the HB laptop story, so YES, it was stolen. But, Trump lost, even enabling the instruments of that loss (Cares Act), he didn't protect the elections, and whether it was stolen or not, crooked Joe Biden is in the WH. Trump was in charge and he let it happen.

13 - **Trump DOES NOT have the ability to engage in meaningful exchanges where he explains and sells his choices, policies, comments, and governing philosophy**. He doesn't fight the narratives festering around him. Calling it ""fake news,"" while true, is not an adequate defense to keep the proposed narrative from defining you. You must attack the narrative and the premises under it with logic, reason, and voracity. If you dismantle the narrative or the argument or the loaded reporter question, you stop the media and democrats from selling their crap to the public. Trump is either unwilling or incapable of doing this, and doing this is extremely integral to getting legislation passed and winning elections.

14 - **He regularly punches down at people and engages in petty battles that mean nothing**. The list of people and organizations Trump has needlessly attacked over some perceived slight or his ego, using the public platform of his Presidency and 2024 candidacy, is too long to catalogue here.

15 - **He doesn't deserve the nomination if he's unwilling to earn it**. He is not owed anything. There is no such thing as ""his turn."" This isn’t a monarchy. Candidates who throw their hat into the ring are NOT “disloyal.” Skipping debates because of 'polling numbers' is entitled and indicative of someone who is afraid to defend his record or defend his reasons for seeking a second term. He is not even campaigning more than a few times a month. He spends his days golfing and rage truthing and making dozens of ludicrous video mini-speeches, as if he’s still President.

16 - He's a clever politician, entertainer, marketer, and businessman, but **his positions and principles are often for sale if the deal is right**.

17 - **Trump is woefully arrogant, a malignant narcissist**, and makes every single thing about himself. He rarely says ""we,"" refers to himself constantly in the 3rd person, and that says a lot.

18 - Trump's campaign is tangentially about the future, but that's not the main thrust of it. **His campaign is mostly about revenge and his ego**, not the good of the country. If he was thinking solely about the country, he would drop out, handle his legal woes, and help us do what he was unable to do.

19 - **Ultra MAGA, his cult following, not the persuadable, is nothing more than an identity group engaging in identity politics**.

Trump is their vehicle, their champion, because he is the embodiment of their moral evolution. He was in 2016 what they've become in 2023.
If this battle is not about realistic policy goals and re-constitutionalizing our government, and it's about name-calling, tearing down proven conservatives and good people, and constantly lobbing hate and false accusations, we deserve to lose. We are no better than the leftists who do it.

Recent example - While it is true that Israel and Bibi failed to secure their borders and protect their citizens, Trump did NOT need to harp on this obvious failure 4 days after Israel’s 9/11 scale terrorist attack. He publicly criticized Bibi, the IDF Defense minister, and then showed respect to the enemy of Israel, Hezbollah, as “very smart.” The bodies of our 25 countrymen and 1400 allies were not even cold. American hostages remain un-rescued. Trump lacks wisdom. He lacks timing. He lacks leadership. Right after the slaughter of innocents, Trump chose to highlight his personal issues with Netanyahu, and that is disgusting.

25 - **Trump 2023 is NOT Trump 2016, and it isn't even close**. Some of it is clearly his age. Trump spends his days golfing, rage-truthing, and delivering Trump PSAs to his iPhone in front of his Mar-A-Lago fireplace. In many ways, Trump is like my rapidly aging Great Uncle, who slurs his words, can't hear very well, screams at the television, and tells stories about the ""good ole' days"" where he is always the central heroic figure. My Great Uncle is entertaining, but I'd be nuts to take a single thing he says as fact or take one piece of advice he gives outside of how to make his eggs for breakfast. This is Trump in front of waning crowds in 2023—a disillusioned and delusional entertainer who tells every story with himself at the center, who rails at unseen enemies, and who hasn't yet realized that his time to leave the stage has long since passed.

**Conclusion** – Trump’s failures as President, his challenges in getting elected and governing effectively, and his deep and pervasive personal flaws leads to ONLY ONE conclusion - **Trump is NOT qualified to be our choice for President in 2024**. Choosing a path for our country that includes Trump in any role of leadership will lead to the ruination of the GOP and to a trifecta of Democrat power and every leftist law imaginable.

The Only Choice — DeSantis has all the leadership traits in spades. He is a much, MUCH better option moving forward. He's not an entertainer. But he is an honest, competent, highly intelligent, effective, and principled leader. He can also serve 2 terms.
RD isn’t “bought” a “RINO” or a “globalist."" Those people who try to use “guilt by association” ignore Trump’s associations with these same people WHILE he was in office and afterward (Ryan, Rove, Bush, etc.). Trump endorsed and is endorsed by numerous ""RINOs.""

DeSantis, however, came from a middle-class family. He's a veteran, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in Congress who sold all his stock to avoid even the hint of impropriety. He rejected his Congressional pension because he believes government should be about selfless-service. He left Congress after three terms because he believes in term limits. He then became the best governor Florida has ever seen, delivering on every single promise. DeSantis is a family man and a fighter against false narratives. He’s also a 5-time winner who has done ALL he said he would do. He’s a relentless, shrewd administrator and leader who gives us the best chance to win and make a significant dent in the government bureaucracy.

The Presidency should not be a sepulchre for the aging politicians, family dynasties, statesmen, or even heroes of our time. 
The Presidency should not house the idols of our sports teams, films, or TV programs. 
The Presidency should not raise any man to the office  who might be esteemed to be more than he is, just a man. 
The Presidency should be attained by a man who is willing to put country before self, who has the energy to work 80–90-hour weeks, who does what is objectively and morally right, no matter the cost. 
The Presidency should be given to a man who has proven his honesty, who has delivered on his promises, who has fought his enemies and won time and again, and who has led with competence, integrity, humility, empathy, and effectiveness through challenging times and crises. 
Ron DeSantis should be chosen as our next President. There has never been a clearer choice. It’s simply time to turn the page on Trump. We have a MUCH better option.",0.45893192284141865,0.08290837583122448

Donald Trump,Conservative,A Wakeup Call for rConservative," There are many in this subreddit who complain that Donald Trump and his political platform (as much as he has one) is not really conservative. This, to be completely clear, is an entirely meaningless statement once people realize that what conservatism entails has shifted many times throughout history having been influenced by politicians/intellectuals more times than I can count. 

We move from the agrarian Jeffersonian republics to the paternalistic conservatism of Henry Clay, to the protectionist/state sponsored economic nationalism of Henry Carey, to the fiscal conservatism and aggressive foreign policy of Eisenhower, to the libertarian influenced Reagan, to the compassionate conservatism of Bush/Romney/Mccain, ending at the populist Trumpism. 

Trump’s protectionist tariffs are reminiscent of Henry Clay/Henry Carey’s nationalistic approach to conservatism which focused on building domestic industries as a lack of economic independence/growth would limit the nation’s freedom. Trump’s cutting of taxes/regulations/federal agencies is reminiscent of the Reagan/Bush era. As for Trump’s foreign policy as it was so conflicting and incoherent that its difficult to really draw a comparison. In any case, while Trump’s version of conservatism is markedly different from both recent versions of conservatism (Reagon or Bush), its not outside of conservative history/ideology. 

This is not to say you can’t stridently disagree with the form of conservatism he advocates for. My version of conservatism (Neo Conservative Foreign Policy, One Nation Conservative/Red Tory Domestic Policy, Macantyrian Communitarianism Social Policy) is in stark contrast to Trump’s in many ways. I despite Trump’s version of conservatism with an intensity that overshadows the Lincoln Project. I consider him a traitor who tried to undermine our democracy, played fast and loose with national secrets, and violated blatantly violated important norms/traditions of office. In terms of his apparent moral fiber, and yes I try to judge this in my presidential candidates, he seems like a narcissistic serial adulterer whose a serial liar. 

But all of this, my personal/ideological disagreements with Trump, are COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to the question at hand. We cannot deny that Trumpism is a VERSION of conservatism and that its by far the most popular version at the moment. Some conservatives argue that replacing Trump with a more “moderate” candidate will net Republicans a win because they will secure moderate voters, but that’s ignoring the fact that Trump’s version of conservatism was what activated a unique voter base that hadn’t come out for Republicans before. If there isn’t a Trump, then they won’t vote and a moderate candidate will perform much worse than Trump against Biden.

TLDR: Trump is a conservative, despite many’s claims otherwise, just not a Reagan or Bush conservative (more of a combo of Bush/Henry Clay conservative with an incoherent foreign policy). Trump is the Republicans best chance of winning against Biden. I despise that this is the case, but unfortunately it is reality. You can respond to this reality in two way: 1) Vote for Trump because you like him OR as a lesser evil since he’s better than Biden OR 2) Ignore the Presidential vote and focus on the State/Local Level when it comes to rebuilding the conservative bench so that down the line we can replace the current batch of conservatives with ones we actually agree with. I, personally, am going with the latter but I can’t blame people who go with former. ",0,Nov 2023,"positive

Donald Trump,Conservative,Minnesota Supreme Court dismisses ‘insurrection clause’ challenge and allows Trump on primary ballot,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Former President Donald Trump will stay on the Minnesota primary ballot after the state supreme court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit seeking end his candidacy under a rarely-used constitutional provision that forbids those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office.

The Minnesota Supreme Court declined to become the first in history to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to prevent someone from running for the presidency. The court dodged the central question of the lawsuit — does Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol disqualify him from the presidency — by ruling that state law allows parties to put whomever they want on the primary ballot.

“There is no state statute that prohibits a major political party from placing on the presidential nomination primary ballot, or sending delegates to the national convention supporting, a candidate who is ineligible to hold office,” Chief Justice Natalie Hudson ruled.

Joe Biden,Conservative,"Nikki Haley and the myth of ""Generic Republican""","A question to fellow conservatives - who in the current Republican primary field besides Donald Trump is the most **ELECTABLE t**o take on Joe Biden. Electability meaning able to hold the coalition together AND able to make the play in several swing states ? I think as Super Tuesday comes closer, we're going to have  DeSantis/Haley vs Trump.

Ron DeSantis - I can see him going head to head vs Trump on Super Tuesday, I think he just has to survive till Super Tuesday to see what happens. His campaign overall has been lacking and I think his abortion stance alone is toxic in swing states in the mid west. 6 week stuff won't go with most people. His online fans have claimed that he would easily beat Biden, doubt it.

Vivek - I think he will drop out soon. I'm excluding him, because he seems like a guy who just wants to get some attention and play the ""anti establishment"" guy. I don't see him surviving till Super Tuesday.

Then we come to Nikki Haley.

Nikki Haley -  Since the 2nd debate, people are really astroturfing her as the ""most electable generic Republican"" What this really means according to Con Inc media class is that will bring out those Russia hawks and abortion loving dems in her side. Her ""electability"" is as fake as ""moderate"" shtick - because all she is, is a 2004 style Republican. And the real reason why she's trouncing Biden right now is because voters are still largely undecided on her.  Haley's electability depends on people not knowing who she is and her not being under a giant spotlight.  She's had zero negative Ads against her. Wants she's dirtied up she will poll much closer to RDS. I'm seeing alot of online astroturfing for her as she is real alternative to Trump ( previously it was DeSantis ), simply because she's a return to 2004 - 2014, without being anti Trump as she worked under the Trump admin in the United Nations. 

Who really is the best alternative to Trump among these ? 

There's also a theory where all these people can bring out ""moderates"" on their sides, but they could lose turnout from Trump voters, mean while if Trump runs those ""moderates"" stay home but we see a turnout from Trump voters. The elections we had last week illustrated that 1) abortion 2) turnout problem from Rs.

Donald Trump,Conservative,"Nikki Haley and the myth of ""Generic Republican""","A question to fellow conservatives - who in the current Republican primary field besides Donald Trump is the most **ELECTABLE t**o take on Joe Biden. Electability meaning able to hold the coalition together AND able to make the play in several swing states ? I think as Super Tuesday comes closer, we're going to have  DeSantis/Haley vs Trump.

Ron DeSantis - I can see him going head to head vs Trump on Super Tuesday, I think he just has to survive till Super Tuesday to see what happens. His campaign overall has been lacking and I think his abortion stance alone is toxic in swing states in the mid west. 6 week stuff won't go with most people. His online fans have claimed that he would easily beat Biden, doubt it.

Vivek - I think he will drop out soon. I'm excluding him, because he seems like a guy who just wants to get some attention and play the ""anti establishment"" guy. I don't see him surviving till Super Tuesday.

Then we come to Nikki Haley.

Nikki Haley -  Since the 2nd debate, people are really astroturfing her as the ""most electable generic Republican"" What this really means according to Con Inc media class is that will bring out those Russia hawks and abortion loving dems in her side. Her ""electability"" is as fake as ""moderate"" shtick - because all she is, is a 2004 style Republican. And the real reason why she's trouncing Biden right now is because voters are still largely undecided on her.  Haley's electability depends on people not knowing who she is and her not being under a giant spotlight.  She's had zero negative Ads against her. Wants she's dirtied up she will poll much closer to RDS. I'm seeing alot of online astroturfing for her as she is real alternative to Trump ( previously it was DeSantis ), simply because she's a return to 2004 - 2014, without being anti Trump as she worked under the Trump admin in the United Nations. 

Who really is the best alternative to Trump among these ? 

There's also a theory where all these people can bring out ""moderates"" on their sides, but they could lose turnout from Trump voters, mean while if Trump runs those ""moderates"" stay home but we see a turnout from Trump voters. The elections we had last week illustrated that 1) abortion 2) turnout problem from Rs.

Joe Biden,Libertarian,Libertarianism and free speech on reddit.,"One of the major draws to libertarianism is the free speech aspect. Every other party silences people to a degree, however historically libertarian and ancap subreddits were bastions of free speech. The fundamental idea is that stupid ideas should be shot down by the community. 

If a commie says, but why shouldnt wealth be redistributed to the poor? They need to eat! That is an idea that needs to be engaged with and shot down. Not with force, but with solid rebuttals. If you want to see gatekeeping in action, go to the democrats or the socialist or the communist forums. They will silence you so quick over little things. For example, dems will ban you for suggesting to vote against joe biden in the democratic primaries. (talk about a cult in action) Communists will ban you for trolling if you say china will fail due to its overreliance on its real estate sector and bad demographics. 

Also, personal story time. A long long time ago on  a different reddit account, I posted that biden should be voted against in favor of bernie on the democrats subreddit in a comment thread. I was banned by a moderator for that. And that is what pushed me away from the democrat party. I found mutualism, and then drifted over to being an ancap, and by the time that the election rolled around, i didnt vote for joe biden. That was because of a democrat mod who thought he was shutting down someone and doing a good job for their sub. He lost a real life voter that election, and probably next election too. Think about that. 

Now, what can be done about moderation? Temp bans. Trolls and disruptive types should be banned. However, final banhammers need to be for repeat serious violations, and not for one off comments. 

Second, as a community, community outreach should be happening, and dedicated daily threads to just chat and bs in should be at the top of the page. 

Third on the topic of community outreach, one of the major accusations leveled against libertarians is that we never get anything done. I would love to be able to do targeted community outreach missions. Basic things like giving out food to homeless people, setting homeless up with their first bitcoin wallet, and teaching them how the system works, and maybe giving them a few dollars of bitcoin, maybe even some job matching initiatives. 

There are alot of problems in america today, and lots of american politics is about bitching and moaning until the government is elected and then letting the government fix it. We the people don't need the government. As libertarians we should be putting the government to shame, and putting the government out of business. 

There is a revolution happening in AI, and at the same time, there is a revolution in money and finance with bitcoin and with tokenized gold. We should be working hand in hand with other communities to create an economy that is anathema to the fed. We should be working towards making systems that endrun the patent system so hard, and distribute the power to resist so widely that the entire patent and accreditation monopoly collapses.

We could be winning elections left and right. We should be taking the presidency in 2024, theres more than enough disaffected republican and democrat voters to pull it off. However, the last thing we need is disaffected democrats or republicans being pushed back to their respective parties by censorship from the libertarian party of all places. ",6,Nov 2023,"positive

what was the final result of vote histories within Pa in regards to the 2020 election

\><

Joe Biden won Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes in the 2020 US presidential election.  
  
Biden received 3,458,229 (50.01%) votes to Trump's 3,377,674 (48.84%). This was a margin of 80,555 votes, or 1.17%.  
  
Biden's victory was a turnaround for Democrats, who had lost the state to Trump by a narrow margin of 0.72% in 2016. Biden won some of the state's most populous counties, including Philadelphia, Allegheny, and Montgomery. He also won the support of suburban voters and Black voters, who had turned out in large numbers.  
  
Trump's campaign filed several lawsuits challenging the results of the election in Pennsylvania, but none of the lawsuits were successful.  
  
The final result of the 2020 election in Pennsylvania was:  
  
Joe Biden: 3,458,229 (50.01%)  
Donald Trump: 3,377,674 (48.84%)

what happened to the ""troubling"" discrepancies found by republican lawmakers?

\><

  
In the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, a group of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania alleged that they had found ""troubling discrepancies"" between the numbers of total votes counted and the total number of voters who voted. They argued that these discrepancies were evidence of widespread voter fraud and that the results of the election should be overturned.  
  
However, these allegations have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and experts. A comprehensive review of the election data by the Pennsylvania Department of State found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The Department of State also concluded that the discrepancies cited by the Republican lawmakers were the result of normal data entry errors and did not affect the outcome of the election.  
  
Despite the lack of evidence, some Republican lawmakers continue to promote the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. These claims have been used to justify efforts to restrict voting rights and to undermine public trust in the electoral process.  
  
The allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been the subject of numerous legal challenges. All of these challenges have been unsuccessful. In fact, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the allegations of voter fraud were ""speculative"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""  
  
The ""troubling discrepancies"" cited by Republican lawmakers have never been substantiated. The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and experts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

debunked by whom and how was it debunked

\><

  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania were debunked by a variety of sources, including:  
  
Election officials: The Pennsylvania Department of State conducted a comprehensive review of the election data and found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Additionally, election officials in numerous counties across the state have certified the results of the election, confirming that there was no widespread voter fraud.  
  
Experts: Numerous experts in election law and statistics have reviewed the allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania and found them to be baseless. For example, a report by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that the allegations were ""not credible"" and ""lacked any credible evidence.""  
  
Courts: Several lawsuits have been filed alleging voter fraud in Pennsylvania, but all of these lawsuits have been unsuccessful. In fact, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the allegations of voter fraud were ""speculative"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""  
  
Here are some specific examples of how the allegations of voter fraud were debunked:  
  
Claims of more votes than registered voters: This claim was based on a misunderstanding of how voter registration data is collected and maintained in Pennsylvania. The Department of State explained that the voter registration database is constantly being updated, and that there are a number of reasons why a voter might not be registered at the time they vote.  
  
Claims of dead people voting: This claim was based on a list of voters who had allegedly cast ballots in the name of deceased individuals. However, the Department of State found that the list was riddled with errors, and that none of the cases of alleged voter fraud were credible.  
  
Claims of ineligible voters casting ballots: This claim was based on a variety of allegations, including that non-citizens, felons, and underage voters had voted in the election. However, the Department of State found no evidence to support any of these allegations.  
  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials, experts, and courts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

what happened to the ""troubling"" discrepancies found by republican lawmakers?

\><

  
In the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, a group of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania alleged that they had found ""troubling discrepancies"" between the numbers of total votes counted and the total number of voters who voted. They argued that these discrepancies were evidence of widespread voter fraud and that the results of the election should be overturned.  
  
However, these allegations have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and experts. A comprehensive review of the election data by the Pennsylvania Department of State found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The Department of State also concluded that the discrepancies cited by the Republican lawmakers were the result of normal data entry errors and did not affect the outcome of the election.  
  
Despite the lack of evidence, some Republican lawmakers continue to promote the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. These claims have been used to justify efforts to restrict voting rights and to undermine public trust in the electoral process.  
  
The allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been the subject of numerous legal challenges. All of these challenges have been unsuccessful. In fact, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the allegations of voter fraud were ""speculative"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""  
  
The ""troubling discrepancies"" cited by Republican lawmakers have never been substantiated. The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and experts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

debunked by whom and how was it debunked

\><

  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania were debunked by a variety of sources, including:  
  
Election officials: The Pennsylvania Department of State conducted a comprehensive review of the election data and found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Additionally, election officials in numerous counties across the state have certified the results of the election, confirming that there was no widespread voter fraud.  
  
Experts: Numerous experts in election law and statistics have reviewed the allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania and found them to be baseless. For example, a report by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that the allegations were ""not credible"" and ""lacked any credible evidence.""  
  
Courts: Several lawsuits have been filed alleging voter fraud in Pennsylvania, but all of these lawsuits have been unsuccessful. In fact, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the allegations of voter fraud were ""speculative"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""  
  
Here are some specific examples of how the allegations of voter fraud were debunked:  
  
Claims of more votes than registered voters: This claim was based on a misunderstanding of how voter registration data is collected and maintained in Pennsylvania. The Department of State explained that the voter registration database is constantly being updated, and that there are a number of reasons why a voter might not be registered at the time they vote.  
  
Claims of dead people voting: This claim was based on a list of voters who had allegedly cast ballots in the name of deceased individuals. However, the Department of State found that the list was riddled with errors, and that none of the cases of alleged voter fraud were credible.  
  
Claims of ineligible voters casting ballots: This claim was based on a variety of allegations, including that non-citizens, felons, and underage voters had voted in the election. However, the Department of State found no evidence to support any of these allegations.  
  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials, experts, and courts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

Claims of dead people voting: This claim was based on a list of voters who had allegedly cast ballots in the name of deceased individuals. However, the Department of State found that the list was riddled with errors, and that none of the cases of alleged voter fraud were credible.  
  
Claims of ineligible voters casting ballots: This claim was based on a variety of allegations, including that non-citizens, felons, and underage voters had voted in the election. However, the Department of State found no evidence to support any of these allegations.  
  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials, experts, and courts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

what is the purpose of the SURE system  within Pennsylvania's electorial process?

\><

The Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) is a statewide voter registration database in Pennsylvania. It was created in 2000 to improve the accuracy and efficiency of voter registration in the state. SURE is used by county voter registration offices to register voters, maintain voter registration records, and produce voter lists for elections.

Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) Pennsylvania  
  
The purpose of the SURE system is to:  
  
Centralize voter registration data: SURE centralizes voter registration data from all 67 counties in Pennsylvania. This makes it easier for county voter registration offices to access and update voter registration records.  
Improve the accuracy of voter registration data: SURE uses a variety of data sources to verify voter information, such as driver's license records and Social Security records. This helps to ensure that voter registration data is accurate and up-to-date.  
Make voter registration more efficient: SURE makes it easier for voters to register to vote and update their registration information. Voters can register to vote online, by mail, or in person at their county voter registration office. They can also update their registration information online or by mail.  
Produce voter lists for elections: SURE is used to produce voter lists for elections. Voter lists are used by polling places to verify that voters are eligible to vote.  
**SURE is an important tool for ensuring that elections in Pennsylvania are fair and accurate.** It helps to ensure that all eligible voters are able to register to vote and that voter registration records are accurate and up-to-date. SURE also makes it easier for county voter registration offices to produce voter lists for elections.

Donald Trump,Conservative,Failure of “Bidenomics” Is Rankling Americans,"Polls show Americans reject President Biden’s handling of the economy, and it’s not hard to see why. By just about any metric, people are worse off today than they were when Mr. Biden took office. Survey after survey shows voters voicing their dissatisfaction, but the Biden administration remains defiant.

Early this month, The New York Times released a poll finding that former President Donald Trump is thoroughly beating Mr. Biden, including in key swing states. According to the poll, if the next presidential election were held today, Mr. Trump would win with over 300 electoral votes.

This is not an outlier, with many other major polls showing Mr. Trump commanding a significant lead over Mr. Biden on the economy. A CBS poll showed an 8-point swing in favor of Mr. Trump compared with the 2020 election. Once again, the deciding factor for many people is the economy.

The question is, why are voters so down on the economy if the Biden administration is constantly touting its economic record? The simple answer: Facts are stubborn things.

Under Mr. Biden, people are demonstrably worse off, and the Biden administration’s own figures on inflation, jobs and falling household incomes prove it. Yet instead of acknowledging reality, the administration makes excuses while its media sycophants try and fail to gaslight Americans.

It’s like the initial weeks of the NFL season when commentators say a team is “better than its record.” Maybe the referees blew a game-altering call, or maybe a key player was out with an injury one week. Perhaps the team in question faced its most difficult opponents in the first few weeks of the season.

But the excuses, flukes and one-offs can last only so long before fans—and voters—stop buying them and get angry. (Trust us on the topic of angry sports fans: We’re both from Philadelphia.)

That’s what polls are showing: People are feeling the pain of “Bidenomics,” of the government spending, borrowing and printing too much money.

Since Mr. Biden took office, real earnings have plummeted as prices outpace wages: Inflation-adjusted weekly earnings are down about 5% since he took office. The drop in real earnings has piled on the sharp increase in borrowing costs over the last couple of years.

These two effects have cost the typical American family the equivalent of almost $7,400 in lost annual income. That’s more than a month’s pay for the median household. It’s even worse if you’re trying to buy a home today. The monthly mortgage payment on a median-price home has more than doubled under Mr. Biden and will cost a family an extra $13,000 every year for the same house.

At this point, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has estimated that homes are affordable in just five major metropolitan areas in the country, while rents are equally unaffordable.

Facing a cost-of-living crisis, it’s no wonder Americans are drowning in over $1 trillion of credit card debt as they struggle to make it from paycheck to paycheck, taking on multiple jobs at the highest level on record.

With such a gloomy backdrop, of course, people have soured on Bidenomics. With real earnings having fallen behind inflation for 27 of the last 31 months, voters have had enough.

This is feeding into the swing states, where the economy is the single most important issue. Nationwide, 83% of voters say the economy is “very important” in deciding their 2024 presidential vote.

Bloomberg asked swing voters whom they trust to handle the economy, and the results were a solid endorsement of Mr. Trump, who led by 10 points in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, by 15 points in Arizona and North Carolina, and by 20 points in Georgia.

Voters are rejecting the government takeover of their lives, the confiscation of their earnings, and the inflation and debt that come with it. Mr. Biden’s handlers have shown little willingness to fix things, instead relying on the media to spin and cover for them.

Voters aren’t buying the excuses anymore. Bidenomics is clearly a failure.

Donald Trump,Conservative,Thoughts on tonight's 4th GOP Debate,"Wow.  Was the candidates playing draw straws, or draw baseball bats?  If anything is the theme of the night, its a gladiator brawl.  Everyone hit everyone else, and it got messy real fast, and no one came out unscathed or as the clear winner.

The reason the debate turned out the way it did was because of the moderators.  They were terrible.  Like hell, I thought the moderators in the first debate was bad but this was ridiculous.  They couldn't stop any arguments going on the stage.  When they did is was at the worst timing.  They couldn't stop candidates from talking over each other, they didn't hold a candidate when they didn't answer a question well, and the spread on who they asked the same question to and didn't was ridiculous.

I've done a few of these analysis before, and some are easy to see who the winner is, and others are not.  Looking back, I don't know if I can say anyone won, or if anyone lost.  So I think it would be more productive to just give some points on the night, and a comparison of the past four debates.

I'll go in descending order from middle of the stage out:

&#x200B;

Ron Desantis - Over all I think he is the only one where his debate performances actually improved debate over debate.  It wasn't by much, but he stumbled over himself much less than he did back in September.  His attacks on Nikki Hailey landed much better, and he was less afraid of calling people out and getting his hands dirty.  However at times he still doesn't answer the question directly, and other times I feel like he's hitting play on the recording he made before getting on stage.  Overall I think tonight was one of his better performances.

Nikki Hailey -  I feel like her debate performances went in the opposite direction over time.  She started off in September much stronger than anyone anticipated, and really took the fight to other candidates.  But as the debates went on, her performances slipped.  The second debate, she just picked fights with everyone, the third debate she couldn't answer a question, and now she struggled defending her position.  Ron and Vivek jumped her tonight, and even though she held her own on some occasions, on others she fell flat.  Especially when it came to how she changes her mind on certain policies and walks them back (such as the media policy).  

Vivek Ramaswamy - I swear the only thing consistent about him is the polarizing outlook he gets from voters.  He either won the night in a landslide or or didn't even make it past the start line.  I get dizzy listening to how he flips back and fourth on issues.  The moderators pointed it out perfectly, first debate everyone was bought out hacks, to the second debate where he had respect for everyone one stage, to being back to everyone is a bought hack.  However the last two debates we did get some policy specifics from him, which is an improvement from the first two.  but at the same time, his far below the belt insults hurts him more than it does good.

Chris Christie - I feel like his debate performances are very consistent overall.  Combative, in your face, and the only one willing to take on Donald Trump.  I felt like Christie was the parent in the room tonight, consistently holding people when they didn't answer the question, and calling people out for their unwillingness to go after Donald Trump, and for saying one thing on the debate stage, and another on the campaign trail.  However attacking Donald Trump the way he does has its advantages and disadvantages, and even when booed is able to keep his composure and power through the message he is trying to send.  This debate performance almost mimics his first, in almost every way, which definitely got more attention, but also brought a lot of fire his way.

&#x200B;

All in, I feel like this was a repeat of the first debate.  I was hoping for more of the third, where we really got a good amount from specifics from all the candidates, but I feel like this debate went backwards rather than forwards.  The moderators control, caused the outcomes, and it shows.

Joe Biden,Republican,Arizona 's Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs demands $512 millions reimbursement from Biden in scathing letter accusing him of failure to secure southern border,"Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has accused President Joe Biden of failing to secure the southern border, and is seeking half a billion dollars in federal reimbursement for the state's spending on the crisis.

In a letter on Friday, which Hobbs released publicly, the governor requested more than $512 million in federal funds to reimburse state spending on illegal alien transport, drug interdiction, and law enforcement 'due to the federal government's failure to secure our border.'

It comes after Customs and Border Protection encounters with illegal aliens at the southern border reportedly hit a one-day high of 12,000 on Tuesday, including more than 10,200 who were detained illegally entering the US from Mexico between ports of entry.

On Monday, CBP closed the Lukeville border crossing in Arizona indefinitely, in order to surge agents from the crossing to help arrest and process a flood of illegal aliens walking across the border to claim asylum.

The desolate area around the remote crossing has become a global illegal migration route in recent months, with smugglers dropping off illegal foreigners from countries as far flung as Senegal, India and China. 

Most of them are walking into the US west of Lukeville through gaps in the wall, then turn east toward the official border crossing to surrender to the first agents they see to claim asylum, according to the AP.

Hobbs in her letter slammed the closing of the Lukeville crossing, saying it 'has led to an unmitigated humanitarian crisis in the area and has put Arizona's safety and commerce at risk.'

'Our ports of entry are essential to our state and our country's economy, and it is vial that they be properly staffed and resourced to continue to fuel economic growth in the state,' she added.

Hobbs called for National Guard members who are currently on active federal duty be mobilized to assist CBP in manning the Lukeville crossing, so it can be reopened.

The White House and CBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com on Saturday morning.

In a statement last week, CBP said it was 'surging all available resources to expeditiously and safely process illegal aliens' and will 'continue to prioritize our border security mission as necessary in response to this evolving situation.' 

The agency blamed the hundreds of people arriving daily around Lukeville on 'smugglers peddling disinformation to prey on vulnerable foreign individuals.' 

Alongside Governor Hobbs, Arizona Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema have slammed the Lukeville closure and demanded better solutions from Biden's administration.

'This is an an unacceptable outcome that further destabilizes our border, risks the safety of our communities, and damages our economy by disrupting trade and tourism,' they said in a joint statement. 

Illegal foreign nationals  line up at a remote U.S. Border Patrol processing center after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday in Lukeville, Arizona. A surge of foreigners illegally passing through openings cut by smugglers in the border wall has overwhelmed U.S. immigration authorities, causing them to shut down several international ports of entry so that officers can help process the new arrivals. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)

'The Federal Government must act swiftly to maintain port of entry operations, get the border under control, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure the humane treatment of illegal foreign nationals.'

Kelly and Hobbs, both Democrats, and Sinema, an independent who was elected as a Democrat, also criticized 'partisan politicians who parrot talking points while watching the border further deteriorate.'

They said those politicians should instead 'reject the echo chamber and work with us to get something done and keep our communities safe.'

An average of 3,140 people in vehicles and 184 pedestrians entered the U.S. daily in Lukeville during October, according to the U.S. Transportation Department´s latest figures.

Travelers will still be able to cross into or out of the United States through Nogales, Arizona, a three-hour drive to the east, or San Luis, Arizona, a two-hour drive to the west.

\>The National Archives and Records Administration informed House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., that it is preparing to provide unredacted access to 1,799 Joe Biden emails — 62,610 pages — from his time as vice president in the Obama administration. 

\>The emails include “any document or communication in which a pseudonym for Vice President Joe Biden was included,” the letter stated. 

\>Biden has reportedly used Robert Peters, Robin Ware and JRB Ware, pseudonyms that Republicans say he used to discuss dealings with energy giant Burisma when Hunter Biden was a board member of the Ukrainian firm.

\>Also among the trove of emails: communications with Eric Schwerin and/or Devon Archer, former business associates of Hunter Biden. The House Ways and Means Committee [released ](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/event/meeting-on-documents-protected-under-internal-revenue-code-section-6103-3/)documents showing Biden communicated with Schwerin using the “Robin Ware” alias, including 50 emails around Biden’s trip to Ukraine in June 2014.

\>Republicans are looking to support their contention that President Biden was directly involved with his son’s business dealings to enrich himself. Those claims include pointed allegations that the elder Biden took a bribe from Burisma through Hunter to force the ouster of former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the company. 

This will hopefully be the final nail in the Burisma Shokin bribery coffin, not that one is needed.  VP Biden had absolutely no authority to demand that any additional conditions be met for Ukraine to get the loan from America.  ",25,Dec 2023,"negative

>

>  
>•	They devote time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms;  
>  
>•	They do so as a regular course of business;  
>  
>•	They do so predominantly with the goal of earning a profit;  
>  
>•	And they do so through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.  
>  
>Joe Biden saw that this law limited his authority to destroy your Second Amendment rights, so he decided that it didn’t apply to him.  
>  
>Instead, the Biden Administration’s new rule says a gun owner doesn’t even have to buy or sell any firearms to need their FFL – in fact, if they even have a conversation with a friend where they express interest in buying or selling a gun, they may need to pay expensive fees and undergo a complex and intrusive application process to obtain their FFL or risk being thrown in jail.  
>  
>This is exactly the opposite of what the law requires.  
>  
>We need to fight back or President Biden will continue his crusade against the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding Texans.

>None of what President Biden is doing was included in that legislation – in fact, the law explicitly prohibits this type of behavior.  
>  
>The Biden Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is only allowed to require you to get a Federal Firearms License (FFL) under certain, prescribed conditions. However, those conditions used to be confusing. To address this confusion at the request of licensed gun dealers across Texas, Congress included a clarification in the bill: FFL licensing requirements would ONLY BE IMPOSED if a seller meets ALL 4 standards set out in law:  
>  
>•	They devote time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms;  
>  
>•	They do so as a regular course of business;  
>  
>•	They do so predominantly with the goal of earning a profit;  
>  
>•	And they do so through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.  
>  
>Joe Biden saw that this law limited his authority to destroy your Second Amendment rights, so he decided that it didn’t apply to him.  
>  
>Instead, the Biden Administration’s new rule says a gun owner doesn’t even have to buy or sell any firearms to need their FFL – in fact, if they even have a conversation with a friend where they express interest in buying or selling a gun, they may need to pay expensive fees and undergo a complex and intrusive application process to obtain their FFL or risk being thrown in jail.  
>  
>This is exactly the opposite of what the law requires.  
>  
>We need to fight back or President Biden will continue his crusade against the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding Texans. That’s why I submitted my formal ¬¬objection to this new rule, and why I will continue to push back through all possible channels to ensure the law is enforced as it is written and the rights of law-abiding citizens are protected.

Joe Biden,Conservative,"Delta 's American Passenger Claims Her Flight Filled with Alleged Illegal Aliens from Arizona to New York, Raises Concerns About Medical Screening and Taxpayer Expenses Amidst Illegal Immigration Crisis","A furious Delta passenger has accused the airline of flying illegal aliens from Arizona to New York City. 

Ashley St Clair, a right-wing commentator, shared footage on Tuesday that she claimed showed illegal aliens who were recently let out of an immigration detention center at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

She wrote on X: 'My Delta flight from Phoenix appears to be flying illegal aliens who crossed the border and are being shipped to New York. When I asked a Delta representative if this was the case, his response was “What does it matter, they’re humans too” 

'What is happening???? Are taxpayer dollars paying for this????'

It's unclear if the passengers were recently arrived migrants who crossed the US-Mexico border or if they came from detention centers. However, illegal aliens are partially considered illegally in the country after being processed and requesting asylum. (Then they are called asylum seekers although 90% of the cases are ultimately declined due to bogus claims and resulted in deportations)

It's also not clear how their plane tickets were paid for. DailyMail.com has reached out to Delta airlines for comment on this story. 

St Clair continued posting on X about the flight, claiming most of the flight was filled with the alleged illegal aliens, and that they still had bags from the processing center in Phoenix.

She also said one of the alleged illegal aliens was seated next to her in a premium cabin, and expressed concern about whether the undocumented passengers had been medically screened. 

Arizona is seeing a massive influx of illegal aliens crossing the border, with the Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs on Friday ordering the state’s National Guard to the border with Mexico to help federal officials manage it.

Hobbs asked President Joe Biden’s administration a week ago to mobilize 243 Arizona National Guard troops already in the Border Patrol’s Tucson sector that includes Lukeville, Arizona, to help federal officers reopen the border crossing that was indefinitely closed on December 4.

While St Clair's claims are unconfirmed, southern states, particularly Texas, have sent illegal aliens to sanctuary Liberal cities like New York and Chicago.

The northern cities have been overwhelmed by the undocumented newcomers and have run out of shelter room, being forced to turn hotels and public buildings into temporary housing. 

A handful of cities across the U.S. dealing with an influx of homeless undocumented aliens have imposed their own limits on shelter stays, citing a variety of reasons, including spiraling costs, a lack of space and a desire to put pressure on people to either find housing on their own, or leave town entirely. 

Chicago imposed a 60-day shelter limit last month and is poised to start evicting people in early January. In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, has capped the number of migrant families in emergency shelters at 7,500.

Denver had limited migrant families to 37 days but paused the policy this month in recognition of winter’s onset. Single adults are limited to 14 days.

In New York, the first illegal alien families were expected to reach their 60-day limits just days after Christmas, but the mayor’s office said those foreign aliens will receive extensions through early January. Roughly 3,500 undocumented foreign families have been issued notices so far.

Unlike most other big cities, New York has a decades-old “ right to shelter ″ obligating the city to provide emergency housing to anyone who asks.

But officials have warned illegal aliens there is no guarantee they will get to stay in the same hotel, or the same city borough, for that matter.

Adult foreigners without children are already subject to a shorter limit on shelter stays: 30 days. 

Mayor Eric Adams has estimated the city will spend $12 billion over the next three years to handle the influx, setting up large-scale emergency shelters, renting out hotels and providing various government services for illegal aliens. 

Last week the Democrat traveled to Washington DC to continue his campaign to get help from the federal government to deal with the illegal immigration crisis.

However, he said his attempts remain unsuccessful.",30,Dec 2023,"negative

Donald Trump,democrats,Biden’s economy vs. Trump’s in 12 charts,"The presidential election is less than a year away, and economic issues are once again top of mind for voters around the country.
Despite the economy’s rapid recovery from the pandemic, President Biden has struggled to convince Americans that his policies are improving their finances. In polls, the majority of Americans still say they trust former president Donald Trump’s handling of the economy over Biden’s.
Both presidents’ economic records have been defined by the pandemic and its aftershocks. The covid crisis upended the job market, stoked decades-high inflation and added trillions to the federal debt.
The economy today is vastly different than it was in 2017, when Trump took office. But the data shows just how each administration has left its mark: Biden, by adding 14 million jobs in less than three years, bringing the Black unemployment rate to a record low and reducing student loan debt by billions. Trump, meanwhile, presided over a period of low inflation, low interest rates and low gas prices",272,Dec 2023,"positive

Donald Trump,democrats,The case for Donald Trump's disqualification under the 14th Amendment - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington,"If someone is innocent why do they need immunity?

In the case vs Ricjard Nixon immunity was taken off the table when Nixon accepted a pardon. A pardon implies there was a crime. 
If the president was truly immune he would have no reason or need to accept a pardon.

The same DC court of appeals that weighed executive privileges for Richard Nixon is weighing the question for trump. For Nixon they ruled -
“Sovereignty remains at all times with the people, they do not forfeit through elections the right to have the law construed against and applied to every citizen.”

The president is protected while performing his official duties as chief executive. However, The Constitution also says that protection doesn't cover the president violating federal law as he as the chief executive is  bound by oath to defend the constitution and federal law.

Under Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, the president has an affirmative duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Because “[t]he entire ‘executive Power’ belongs to the President alone,” the Take Care Clause vests responsibility to ensure the faithful execution of federal law solely by the president. Among the laws that the president must ensure are faithfully executed are the laws the mob sought to impede including the Twelfth Amendment and the Electoral Count Act, and the federal criminal statutes the mob violated on January 6th. 

As chief executive and commander in chief of the military, President Trump had the unique power and responsibility to defend the Capitol against insurrectionists seeking to prevent the execution of federal law, which was the counting and certification of electoral votes in which he explicitly tried to stop. 

Under Article II, Section 2, “[t]he President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.” Unlike “the National Guard units in 50 States and three territories, where deployment authority lies with the governor of those respective jurisdictions, the DC [National] Guard falls directly under the command of the United States President.

President Trump violated his constitutional duties on January 6th. After being informed that a violent mob was attacking the United States Capitol and disrupting the execution of federal law, Trump failed to act for 187 minutes, watching the attack unfold on television.

Under Article II, Section 2, “[t]he President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.” Unlike “the National Guard units in 50 States and three territories, where deployment authority lies with the governor of those respective jurisdictions, the DC [National] Guard falls directly under the command of the United States President.

President Trump violated his constitutional duties on January 6th. After being informed that a violent mob was attacking the United States Capitol and disrupting the execution of federal law, Trump failed to act for 187 minutes, watching the attack unfold on television.
