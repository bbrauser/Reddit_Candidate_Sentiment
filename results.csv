Chris Christie ,Conservative,I'm a young voter (20) looking forward to my first time voting in a presidential primary in 2024,"Hello!

I'm a young voter (20M) from a swing state which is also rich in primary delegates (Georgia). I'm a Republican as well.

I know Gen Z is very leftist, so I guess I'm writing this post partially to let y'all know that not all of us are leftists (I'm not bashing those who are). 

2024 will be the first presidential primary that I'll be voting in. I watched the 2016 campaign extensively and was with Trump since 2015, although I was 12/13/14 at the time of that election, so I didn't understand as much as I do now. But I spent a lot of my free time watching it, and I also made sure to keep up with the news during Trump's term. If I was voting in 2020, I had better pay attention to the news. In 2020, Trump was the incumbent president, so he had no serious primary challengers. I turned 18 in October 2020 and voted for Trump. But in 2024, there may be multiple high-profile primary contestants.

I was mostly solidly on the Trump Train until the midterms, which were disappointing, to say the least. After that, I started to question Trump's electoral viability, which made me question if nominating him was really a good idea despite his excellent track record as president. 

This may get me downvoted, but I'm not totally on the DeSantis Train yet. I was initially after the midterms, given DeSantis's 19.4-point win in a swing state, but after thinking a lot, I realized I should give it time before deciding who to vote for. After all, people who were once seen as promising can still fade out. Chris Christie won re-election in New Jersey (a safe blue state!) by 22.1%, but we all know how his presidential aspirations turned out. That's not to say DeSantis won't end up winning - but he's not a guaranteed winner yet. Who knows? It's possible that the eventual 2024 nominee will be neither Trump nor DeSantis. 

So, since this is my first presidential primary, I'm going to treat it as seriously as I should. I'm going to spend lots of time researching each declared/potential candidate (the ones who have a considerable amount of support - I'm not wasting my time researching jokers like Liz Cheney, who don't have a chance). I'm going to study their records from their political past, as well as their policy proposals for 2024. Trump, as we know, is already a declared candidate and has been releasing a series of videos on his policy proposals for a second term, and I've been viewing those as they come out. I'm going to read the books that come out as the campaign goes along (I'm already reading Mike Pence's book, and I'm planning on reading Pompeo's book and DeSantis's book when they come out). And I plan on attending at least one of each serious candidate's rallies/speeches. If I can't make it to one near me, I'll at least stream it. This includes a Trump rally, DeSantis rally, Pence, Pompeo, etc. At some point before my state's primary, I'll draw up an overview of each candidate, listing and comparing their pros and cons (policy positions, electability, etc). 

I just wanted to explain that I'm genuinely looking forward to my first time voting in a presidential primary, and I'm excited to do all the necessary research and such for it. And do not bash other people for considering a candidate other than the one you prefer. Calling a DeSantis supporter a ""traitor"" or a Trump supporter a ""cultist"" won't do anything to change their mind. We all want roughly the same policies anyway.

Chris Christie won re-election in New Jersey (a safe blue state!) by 22.1%, but we all know how his presidential aspirations turned out. That's not to say DeSantis won't end up winning - but he's not a guaranteed winner yet. Who knows? It's possible that the eventual 2024 nominee will be neither Trump nor DeSantis. 

So, since this is my first presidential primary, I'm going to treat it as seriously as I should. I'm going to spend lots of time researching each declared/potential candidate (the ones who have a considerable amount of support - I'm not wasting my time researching jokers like Liz Cheney, who don't have a chance). I'm going to study their records from their political past, as well as their policy proposals for 2024. Trump, as we know, is already a declared candidate and has been releasing a series of videos on his policy proposals for a second term, and I've been viewing those as they come out. I'm going to read the books that come out as the campaign goes along (I'm already reading Mike Pence's book, and I'm planning on reading Pompeo's book and DeSantis's book when they come out). And I plan on attending at least one of each serious candidate's rallies/speeches. If I can't make it to one near me, I'll at least stream it. This includes a Trump rally, DeSantis rally, Pence, Pompeo, etc. At some point before my state's primary, I'll draw up an overview of each candidate, listing and comparing their pros and cons (policy positions, electability, etc). 

I just wanted to explain that I'm genuinely looking forward to my first time voting in a presidential primary, and I'm excited to do all the necessary research and such for it. And do not bash other people for considering a candidate other than the one you prefer. Calling a DeSantis supporter a ""traitor"" or a Trump supporter a ""cultist"" won't do anything to change their mind. We all want roughly the same policies anyway.

opinion","I'm a young voter (20) looking forward to my first time voting in a presidential primary in 2024 Hello!

I'm a young voter (20M) from a swing state which is also rich in primary delegates (Georgia). I'm a Republican as well.

I know Gen Z is very leftist, so I guess I'm writing this post partially to let y'all know that not all of us are leftists (I'm not bashing those who are). 

2024 will be the first presidential primary that I'll be voting in. I watched the 2016 campaign extensively and was with Trump since 2015, although I was 12/13/14 at the time of that election, so I didn't understand as much as I do now. But I spent a lot of my free time watching it, and I also made sure to keep up with the news during Trump's term. If I was voting in 2020, I had better pay attention to the news. In 2020, Trump was the incumbent president, so he had no serious primary challengers. I turned 18 in October 2020 and voted for Trump. But in 2024, there may be multiple high-profile primary contestants.

I was mostly solidly on the Trump Train until the midterms, which were disappointing, to say the least. After that, I started to question Trump's electoral viability, which made me question if nominating him was really a good idea despite his excellent track record as president. 

This may get me downvoted, but I'm not totally on the DeSantis Train yet. I was initially after the midterms, given DeSantis's 19.4-point win in a swing state, but after thinking a lot, I realized I should give it time before deciding who to vote for. After all, people who were once seen as promising can still fade out.

Mike Pence ,Liberal,Old scheme to gut Social Security revisited.," 

Here they go again with a new conspiracy to undermine, if not completely kill Medicare and Social Security. Mike Pence recently gave a secretive speech in which he outlined the same scheme George Bush enunciated but was forced to abandon when the wheels fell off his proposal. 

It seems Pence is now conspiring with the likes of Steve Scalise, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and a raft of Congressional Representatives who are owned by Wall Street to *disembowel the system.* 

The scheme is to allow future Social Security recipients to invest 2% of their money in the stock market. 2% doesn’t sound like much, but when considered over the broad expanse of Social Security system the withdrawal of that much money would certainly sink the program. 

Yes, at first blush it all seems good. And it would be if each future senior citizen was astute enough to hitch a ride on a rising market while bypassing a falling market; but what are the odds? One single major dip in the market could wipe out all gains in a heartbeat, and you would still have to pay fees on each purchase and sale to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The brokerage houses don't give a damn if you win, or lose, you pay both ways! That’s why they are underwriting the plot with millions invested in the contrivance.  

Ahh, but it doesn’t stop here. Last June, the Republican Study Committee, of which Scalise is a member, released a budget plan that included numerous suggested reforms for Medicare and Social Security, including raising the eligibility ages for each program to 67 and 70, respectively. The proposal further called for *withholding* *payments* for individuals who retire early or had a certain level of income, (your savings, investments and 401k) and also suggested using private funding sources to replace Medicare. 

“Private funding sources” means private health insurance!. Private health insurance can be summed up in four words: “Sorry, that’s a pre-existing condition.” 

As mentioned, Bush killed his plan because the market hit a downturn and lost over twenty-five percent and seniors gasped when they realized how much they would have lost from their benefits. 

Eyes wide open folks and remember the adage, “If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",109,Feb 2023,"positive

Trump, is now seeking a “very substantial” additional amount in response to his insults on a CNN program just a day after she won her sexual abuse and defamation case.

Ms. Carroll’s filing Monday in Manhattan federal court seeks to intensify the financial pain for Mr. Trump. The jury in her civil case found him liable on May 9 for sexual abuse and defamation. It ordered him to pay Ms. Carroll, a former advice columnist and fixture in Manhattan’s media circles, $2 million for the sexual abuse and $3 million for the defamation.

Monday’s filing came in a separate defamation lawsuit that Ms. Carroll had filed in 2019 against Mr. Trump, 76, which is before the same judge who presided in the civil trial. The older case stemmed from comments Mr. Trump made that year, shortly after she said that he had raped her in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. That lawsuit had been sidetracked by appeals, but is still pending.

In a separate letter to the judge, Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, revealed with little elaboration that Mr. Trump has threatened to file a lawsuit against Ms. Carroll “in retaliation and possibly to seek sanctions.”",47,May 2023,"positive

Joe Biden ,democrats,Joe Biden and Steve Ricchetti are master-negotiators and have pulled of the deal of the century,"**In an extremely difficult negotiation situation where republicans were using almost terrorist tactics by holding the economy hostage:**

* Biden got McCarthy to not only agree on a debt ceiling deal this time, but eliminated having to do it again next year. He demanded and got a two year deal

* He not only got McCarthy to agree to raise the debt ceiling, but to eliminate the ceiling altogether for those two years.

* Biden used the debt ceiling negotiations to strike a deal on the annual budget negotiations which would have had to be completed by October 1st. 

* He has basically made three deals in one:

1: ----------This year’s debt ceiling deal

2: ----------This year’s budget negotiation

3: ----------Next year’s debt ceiling deal


* The $80 billion for the IRS which Kevin McCarthy and the GOP demanded be eliminated, was only reduced to $70 billion which is still the largest increase to the agency in history

* Then Biden will take that $10 billion and spread it across areas of so-called spending cuts to neutralize those spending cuts.

* It appears that  Biden has let them cut food stamps but in reality he got more money and more people will be covered

* Republicans had demanded 18% spending cuts across the board in all government programs except the military. They got none of that.

* And though Biden is clearly the winner in this battle, he can not claim victory yet…, (yet being the key word). Otherwise the republicans may change their mind on voting for it. He is clearly letting them think they won. Well at least that they didn’t lose.

* Biden made it appear McCarthy had a victory by “forcing” Biden to negotiate. And got republicans to believe that.  In reality they got nothing. They only achieved the appearance of a win. Biden didn’t care how it made him look. He just gave McCarthy something to claim as a win.

**And just a couple hours ago, the House Rules Committee controlled by republicans voted 7-6 to allow the deal to be voted on tomorrow.**

As a personal guess, I think a secret deal made have been made to have democrats save McCarthy from getting voted out in the battle that will most definitely occur after the deal is passed. I have no evidence to support this. It's just my prediction.

Donald Trump ,democrats,Be prepared. The worst may still be yet to come...,"Okay, so what we know is that Donald Trump will be indicted tomorrow for Mishandling classified documents. All charges combine would land him in prison for a maximum of more than 400 years.

In the subpoena it request a document regarding a possible airstrike on Iran with classified details. This document was never recovered by the FBI.

The last weekend of July 2022 Donald Trump hosted the Saudi Open at his Mar-A-Lago golf course. Not to be confused with his golf course at Bedminster New Jersey, where he buried his late first wife Ivana Trump at the first hole, for a tax break on his funeral home/golf course. 

This picture shows where some documents were located on August 8th when the FBI went to seize the classified documents and material. This is believed to be the location of these documents during Saudi Arabia's visit to Mar-A-Lago.

This is just one of the locations, a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago filled with boxes of United States secrets, ranging from nuclear capabilities of the United States and allies, as well as positions of armed forces abroad, ETC. Other locations were a ballroom stage, a storage room and 27 documents in Trump's office. Including one highly classified document in his desk drawer.

""Among the items seized, according to the list, were 18 documents marked as top secret, 54 marked as secret, 31 marked as confidential and 11,179 government documents or photographs without classification markings. Forty-eight empty folders marked as having contained classified information were also taken, though the list did not specify whether that information was recovered"" NY Times. So why is Trump only being charged with just 31 counts of retaining government documents?

In order to have a trial to convict Trump, the department of Justice has to show some form of these classified documents to a jury to prove their case. These will probably be heavily redacted or files that are no longer endangering any lives by disclosing what is in them. But there are some files that are so top secret the department of Justice is not even going to bring charges because they would then have to show a jury the substance of these files.

Some believe these are initial charges and there are more charges to come. In my opinion this man will prove to be a traitor to the highest degree and I am extremely interested in seeing what more we learn after the official arrest tomorrow morning. But just a forewarning, don't be surprised if we find out there is so much more to his retention of government document",1022,Jun 2023,"positive

Tim Scott ,Conservative,2024 Election Predictions," First off, this post is not about supporting one candidate over the other. This post is just a crystal ball (some would say on meth) into what I view is the 2024 election.

The most likely election, an election most people don't want: Biden vs. Trump. Based off of polls, obviously, these are your two. I believe Biden wins this pretty easily. He only needs to carry one of these five states: Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, New Hampshire, or Nevada. I think he wins all five. So...this scenario only works because Trump is running. The election would actually be a referendum on Trump, instead of Biden. I do believe a major segment of the population, including most independents, will never vote for Trump (for some, again). You have to win the purple states. Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio are red states to me, which is why he will win those. The five I previously mentioned are the true purple-state battlegrounds, and based off of the 2022 midterms with Trump-backed candidates, I think Trump will not perform so well.

But what if legal troubles catch up to Trump? He then drops out (big if). Following scenarios: Biden vs. Haley/Scott/DeSantis. I'm putting Haley as first, because I think the DeSantis campaign is likely sunken (and the GOP knows it). That leads to either Haley or Scott, and I believe the GOP will coalesce around Haley (it's best to be just floundering about now). If this happens with enough time, I believe Haley would win against Biden pretty easily, as this election would turn into a referendum on Biden. The question is how much time is enough time? (of note, I'm a DeSantis supporter and fan, and my original prediction was for him to win 2024; however, I'm not sure if he's surviving the media onslaught and is becoming damaged goods a la Rubio. If it continues to go south for him, he may consider dropping out until 2028. The best thing for the other GOP candidates to do is to flounder and tread water quietly (Tim Scott, for example), because none of them are getting past Trump while he is still in the game).

But if there is ""enough time,"" the Biden nomination for 2024 may change as well. I believe Biden is only being propped up because his chances are only good for going against Trump. His handlers and people controlling him (most likely the Obama coalition) actually want him in only for the election itself. I certainly believe he would be forced to step down one to two years after the 2024 election. That said, if there is ""enough time,"" and Biden's chances no longer work against Haley or Scott, then the race is on for the Dems to play another card. They would force him to step down mid campaign.

This is their quandary: go with Newsome (favorable in California and the very liberal, not much elsewhere)? go with Harris (very unpopular, very unlikely to me)? RFK Jr. (goes against their views of bigger government)? Bernie or Buttigieg (lol, no)? Wes Moore or Josh Shapiro (too inexperienced)? Whitmer (child, please)?

The only relevant answer for the Dems would be Michelle Obama. Personal opinions aside from her political views and lack of relevant experience, this would only be the point of coalescence for that party and she effectively is their Ace in the Hole for this election, as she is actually favorable as a person.

That said, and I know I'm about to be hung here by the Trump supporters, but if it is not Biden vs. Trump (the election people do not want), it will be Haley vs. Michelle Obama (the election people want).",0,Jul 2023,"positive

Donald Trump ,Liberal,The US is following the trajectory of the Roman Republic before the rise of the imperial dictatorship,"
The level of income inequality and xenophobia go hand and in hand.  This is why we need to understand that Donald Trump and his movement is the natural progression of a society that is utterly corrupt and broken and undemocratic.  The Democrats distract with the social issues and the Republicans are piggybacking off of them to the same effect.   

This has led to the rise of a fascist movement in the U.S.  What will the liberals and leftists do when a real fascist comes to power in the US with the military and police under that movement’s control?  Do you think hashtag activism is going to work against such a group?  

There is a phenomenon on Reddit which is related to this inability to understand any viewpoint other than your own of banning people you don’t agree with or you can’t out argue with your talking points.   The liberals and leftists are going to face a massive backlash from moderates and right wingers and fascists in which they are going to be forced back into the wilderness.   

This is why I have been banned on several subreddits for simple benign statements.  I have been downvoted dozens of times for basic comments which shouldn’t be considered controversial but because it offends someone.  I wonder what these people will do when Trump comes back to power or DeSantis comes to power and he places his anti LGBT book ban in schools across the nation?  

This is why a society like the US is destined to follow Romes path and it will happen sooner rather than later.  Empires fall faster than in the past.  We won’t linger over centuries like Rome.

Vivek Ramaswamy ,Conservative,Takeaways from tonights GOP Primary Debate:," Thoughts on the night:

Winners:

Niki Hailey - I thought she was too timid as a candidate but she came out swinging and really took the fight to some candidates, got some great reactions, and really stood her ground.

Chris Christie - He really took a baseball bat to this entire stage, I think this'll play in his favor, he saw bull, smelled blood, and he went after them. Vivek and Christie really went at it, and I really think he exposed Viveks flaws, and even though he got booed for his stance against Trump, he powered through it, stuck to his message, and showed strength.

Neutral:

Ron Desantis: After seeing his campaign for the last few months everyone thought he would just tank tonight. But I think he did ok, but certainly not great. He shows more fight on stage than we though he had.

Mike Pence - I think the same about him. He did ok, he fought back, landed some punches, but others didn't stick.

Losers:

Vivek Ramaswamy: I think he lost the most tonight. He sounds like a broken record playing backwards, everyone picked up on it, and jumped him for it. His inexperience in policy shows tonight.

Tim Scott - I don't think he got nearly as much screen time as he hoped. I felt like he barley was even there. So yea he got some policy out, but he was out and on the sidelines for all the fights, showing no contrasts to other candidates.

Doug Burgum - I'm happy he was able to make it on stage with his leg injury. But I feel the same about him than I did for Tim Scott, he just didn't get enough air time, and I felt like his policies are just mediocre.

Asa Hutchinson - Same thing not enough screen time. Even when talking about Trumps indictments, he was too relaxed on something that is a big issue for him.

Vivek and Christie really went at it, and I really think he exposed Viveks flaws, and even though he got booed for his stance against Trump, he powered through it, stuck to his message, and showed strength.

Neutral:

Ron Desantis: After seeing his campaign for the last few months everyone thought he would just tank tonight. But I think he did ok, but certainly not great. He shows more fight on stage than we though he had.

Mike Pence - I think the same about him. He did ok, he fought back, landed some punches, but others didn't stick.

Losers:

Vivek Ramaswamy: I think he lost the most tonight. He sounds like a broken record playing backwards, everyone picked up on it, and jumped him for it. His inexperience in policy shows tonight.

Tim Scott - I don't think he got nearly as much screen time as he hoped. I felt like he barley was even there. So yea he got some policy out, but he was out and on the sidelines for all the fights, showing no contrasts to other candidates.

Doug Burgum - I'm happy he was able to make it on stage with his leg injury. But I feel the same about him than I did for Tim Scott, he just didn't get enough air time, and I felt like his policies are just mediocre.

Asa Hutchinson - Same thing not enough screen time. Even when talking about Trumps indictments, he was too relaxed on something that is a big issue for him.

Donald Trump ,Conservative,Do you think Trump just won the election tonight?,"I did not vote Donald Trump nor republican the last two elections (I also did not vote democrat). I do not agree with Trump on everything, I think he has a massive ego, but he is funny as hell and charismatic. Still, I had no intention of voting for him prior to this whole indictment ploy by the democrats.

To me, this is bigger than Trump. There is a group of corrupt people right now trying to put their political opponent in prison. It is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in the most unbiased way. I want to vote for RFK Jr. because my main concern in current times is censorship and he best aligns with my views.

However, it's not about the candidate. I have this unyielding urge now to support the victim of this political abuse. This is about protesting a precedent. It feels important to make an example of this and show the democrats that if they engage in evil behavior to try to win the election, they will fail and their opponent will win.

I wonder how many others feel this way or will eventually feel this way as the details of this indictment that MSM ignore eventually come to light later in the election season.",0,Aug 2023,"positive

Ron DeSantis ,Conservative,An appeal to Trump absolutists - from a conservative who deeply loves America,"I'm a 30 year old conservative and have been since I got into politics in high school. The first candidate I ever supported was Ron Paul. I'm a mathematician who works in tech, which is why I'm posting on an alternate account - worried about being outed in my highly liberal social circle or being fired for being openly conservative.

I like Trump. I don't agree with him on everything and wish he were less divisive and abrasive, but even with his faults, I like him. He was a breath of fresh air and a good president.

But I believe Trump has served his purpose, and it's time to pass the torch. As much as Trump fires up conservatives, he fires up liberals and independents against him. **Trump has the lowest electability of nearly every Republican candidate running.**

That's not just a feeling - it's grounded in facts. Check out [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/RZQVYmJ) of an aggregator of election betting markets. These percentages are based on people betting money, and while they aren't perfect, they are quite accurate.

You can roughly determine a candidate's electability (i.e. the probability they win the general election, conditional on them winning the primary) using these numbers. Simply take US Presidency 2024 Percent and divide by GOP Nomination 2024 Percent.

Vivek = 7.3 / 10.8 = 69% of becoming president if the GOP nominee

Haley = 2.2 / 3.4 = 65%

DeSantis = 5 / 8 = 63%

Christie = 0.8 / 1.5 = 53%

Trump = 27.9 / 69 = 40%

Other candidates = I can't easily calculate because their numbers aren't displayed, but I bet they are almost all higher than Trump's 40%.

Of course, electability isn't all that matters. We have to judge the quality of the candidate and vote for whom we believe in. But let's say you consider Trump to be a 10/10, and maybe you consider Vivek and DeSantis to be 8/10. I'll take an 8/10 with a 65-69% chance of winning over a 10/10 with a 40% chance of winning.

Personally, I like Vivek and DeSantis, followed by Haley, but my point is that you should be taking electability into account, and even if Trump is your top choice, you should consider candidates other than Trump.

Friendly request to non-Trump conservatives - please be civil with Trump supporters. No one ever changes their mind after being insulted. Let's used reasoned arguments grounded in fact, as conservatives should do. We need to work together to win in 2024 and put our country on the right track.

Asa Hutchinson ,Conservative,What does Doug Burgum have to offer?,"I donated $1 to Doug Burgum to receive a $20 prepaid card. I bought McDonald's with it. 

I figured the least I could do for that, my highest-yield investment to date, was give him a chance if he got to the stage. 

But he got there, and I was unimpressed.

It's entirely possible that his lackluster performance was due to the unfortunate leg injury he suffered a day before the debate. I'm sure it was painful for him to even stand there. 

But I'm inclined to think that the only thing his leg injury affords him is some allowance with the occasional stutter or verbal stumble he suffered in the debate. If he'd been able to verbalize his positions clearly without those, I still wonder why he's in this race. 

He's clearly trying to be the ""energy"" candidate. (Not energy like get up and go energy, I mean nuclear energy, coal, raw materials energy.)

But there's very little appetite for a candidate like that in this race. 

There is one thing I like about him, and for me it's a pretty big thing. Though the pocket constitution was a sad gimmick, I wholeheartedly agree that abortion should be a states issue. As much as Vivek claimed to be the guy who says what nobody else will, Doug was the only person who said exactly what I feel about abortion: we fought for 50 years to bring it back to the states, and now that we have that we want to turn it right back to the federal government. 

As much as I agree with Doug on abortion, I fail to see what value he brings as a candidate. You could view the entire Republican primary stage as redundant in the wake of Trump's staggering support, but it's clear to anyone that Doug and Hutchinson at the very least shouldn't show up for the next debate, even if they meet the requirements. They simply don't offer enough to voters. Doug probably agrees with most of the candidates on most issues, but has zero charisma, and Asa is running the same campaign as Christie, but with less charisma. They're redundant. 

Side note: every time Asa was on camera, I kept thinking of that coworker when Dwight worked at Staples in The Office: ""I don't like him, his big head, or his beady little eyes. And that's all I've got to say on the matter.""",1,Aug 2023,"negative

Joe Biden ,Conservative,70% of redditors are brainwashed beyond all recognition,"Almost every subreddit in this app is far left. These people despise Trump to the point that they want to re-elect the guy who’s spent 80 billion dollars in 2 years on a war we’re not even fighting. It doesn’t click in my head how someone could be so blind to the truth. 

By all means, trump is not perfect. But I do believe he has most Americans best interest at heart. People put Biden into office because they thought Trump was a Russian spy. But if anyone is that, it’s going to be biden. The whole hunter biden dealings with Joes name attached, and the large sums of money being sent to Ukraine is fishy.

 I’m not a conspiracy theorist but for the life of me I can’t understand how we justify spending all that money in Ukraine while so many of us are working 60 hours a week and still struggling to pay the bills back in America. We send 80b dollars and yet Ukraine is still losing the war. We’re gonna keep sending money until Russia eventually outnumbers them and wins. It will result in Biden having his pockets lined with cash, zero Ukrainian men left alive to tell the tale, and millions of Americans left suffering. 80b dollars can do a whole lot of good in our country, but people want to justify giving it to a country that was previously one of the most corrupt in the world just because they think we’re helping fight the people who elected trump into office. 

Sorry for the rant, I know most of you will think I’m some hard right Trump dick rider but in reality I’m just a suffering father who seen blatant courruption everyday for the past 2 years. I love this country and everyone who resides here no matter what they identify as, but it feels like the beginning of the end of this great empire. I feel very unheard in todays world, because no matter how fair some of my conservative views are, I’m labeled as a racist or something else of the sorts. I am not a full on conservative, I have views that are both left and right. But the only thing that liberals see is the “fascist” conservative views. I don’t know what’s to come, but im scared for the world that my kids are going to grow up in. It’s the first time in my life I’ve ever started to consider relocating to a different country. I can’t stand the entitlement of everyone nowadays. People use to have respect for one another. They could agree to disagree. But now it’s all my way or no way.",45,Aug 2023,"positive

I’ve been doing other things.”

This immediately caught the eye of New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman, who responded by telling CNN that it’s “notable” that Trump threw his own son Eric to the wolves by “making Eric the front person in the context of this lawsuit” and fingering his son as the “responsible party” in the Trump Organization’s fraud.  

So there you have it, folks. Trump has finally reached the point where he is throwing his own children — who have been his most loyal supporters — to the wolves in order to save his own skin. 

What a fitting and pathetic ending to Trump’s criminal family enterprise.

Donald Trump ,Conservative,Donald Trump is not inevitable. Here is why.,"Donald Trump is, by any reasonable standard, the most likely candidate to win the GOP nomination in 2024. He is, however, not inevitable, and a brief look at past primaries demonstrates why:

First, let's examine Iowa: RCP currently has Trump ahead by an average of 26 points, and at roughly 42 percent in the polls: [https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/ia/2024\_iowa\_republican\_presidential\_caucus-8164.html](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/ia/2024_iowa_republican_presidential_caucus-8164.html).  This is obviously a large margin, however, let's examine past Iowa results and polling history:

2004 Democratic Iowa Caucus: At this time in 2003, eventual winner John Kerry was a distant third, essentially tied with Wesley Clark. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion\_polling\_for\_the\_2004\_Democratic\_Party\_presidential\_primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2004_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries). On election day, he received 37.6% of the delegate share: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004\_Iowa\_Democratic\_presidential\_caucuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Iowa_Democratic_presidential_caucuses). That constitutes a swing of roughly 28%. A 28% swing would give either DeSantis or Scott a victory.

2008 Democratic Iowa Caucus: At this point Obama was clearly third, and Hillary Clinton had a commanding lead: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide\_opinion\_polling\_for\_the\_January\_2008\_Democratic\_Party\_presidential\_primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_January_2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries). The difference between early September polling and the eventual results was somewhere around 17-24%. Again, the upper end of that would give a victory to either DeSantis or Scott.

2008 Republican Iowa Caucus: At this point, eventual winner was a distant fourth in polling: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide\_opinion\_polling\_for\_the\_2008\_Republican\_Party\_presidential\_primaries#Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_2008_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries#Iowa). He jumped from anywhere from 4-12% to 34% of the final vote. Again, this shift would give a victory to either Scott or DeSantis.

2012 Republican Iowa Caucus: Eventual winner Rick Santorum was at 2-4%(!) in polls at this point: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide\_opinion\_polling\_for\_the\_January\_2012\_Republican\_Party\_presidential\_primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_January_2012_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries). He finished with 24% and a narrow victory.

2016 Democratic Iowa Caucus: Hillary Clinton commanded around 43% of the polling at this point and Bernie Sanders was a distant second: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016\_Iowa\_Democratic\_presidential\_caucuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Iowa_Democratic_presidential_caucuses). Clinton narrowly won by less than 1%.

2016 Republican Iowa Caucus: Eventual winner Ted Cruz was at a distant third or fourth: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016\_Iowa\_Republican\_presidential\_caucuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Iowa_Republican_presidential_caucuses). He gained around 20% between then and election day.

2008 New Hampshire Republican Primary: Eventual winner John McCain was a distant third at this point: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide\_opinion\_polling\_for\_the\_2008\_Republican\_Party\_presidential\_primaries#New\_Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_2008_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries#New_Hampshire)

Now, not all primaries/caucuses turn out this way. In 2012 Mitt Romney was favored much of the time in New Hampshire and won the state. Polling for later states doesn't have the same easily accessible history.

But with that caveat, here's the central point:

No, fuck that shit, we're all in this together and we have to have each other's backs, *that's* why I'm a liberal, because the harm done to a human is harm done to humanity.  
  
I don't vote for liberals because I hate conservative, I vote for liberals because I love my country, and I even love those countrymen that I don't like very much.

When I cast my ballot for Joe Biden in 2020, I didn't do it out of spite at Donald Trump, I cast a ballot for Joe Biden because I care about environmental responsibility, and women's reproductive care, and collective bargaining rights for unions, and a competent public health response to COVID, and prescription bargaining rights for Medicare, and infrastructure investments, and a thousand other things that make our country stronger, healthier, and more resilient.

Now look, I'm not going to try to change your mind, I'm just speaking my own, how *you* feel about conservatives is your own business, but for my part, I don't hate them.  I hate how they vote, but I don't hate *them.*

If DJT wasn't running, he would *clearly* get the largest shares of Trump's votes. It's very clear to me, at this point, that DeSantis is viewed as the next most popular candidate. He's obviously not done as well in the debates and primaries as many of us thought he would. He's also obviously not going to win the nomination. He's butted heads with Trump, and Trump's butted heads with him, long enough. Trump claims he wants to unite the party and move on. 

I think the HoR should elect DeSantis as Speaker. Give him a national platform to push good policy like he has in Florida, give him a lot of time and experience in the capital, and maybe by 2028 he will be ready to go, or he won't and he can remain Speaker. He's great on policy for the most part, and that's exactly what you want in a Speaker or Senate Majority leader.

Donald Trump ,Conservative,Judge outlines next steps for dissolving Trump's companies," As the questioning of witnesses continues, Judge Engoron has issued an order outlining the next steps to dissolve Trump's companies in New York.

Engoron [last week](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-submitted-fraudulent-valuations-assets-secure-loans/story?id=103508205) found that Trump and his adult sons used fraudulent documents to conduct business, and ordered the cancellation of his business certificates in the state. Trump appealed that ruling yesterday.

In today's order, Engoron asks the defendants to provide a list of ""entities controlled or beneficially owned by Donald J. Trump"" -- and the other co-defendants -- to the Hon. Barbara S. Jones, the independent monitor overseeing Trump's business activities.

Trump is also required to notify Jones of any new business applications or changes to preexisting entities.

The order also gives the parties 30 days to recommend a receiver to oversee the dissolution of Trump's corporate assets. However both parties previously suggested that they plan to recommend Jones for that position.
